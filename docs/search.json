We will use openai’s gpt-4o model. The ellmer package allows connection to many different ai APIs. ellmer also allows meticulous specification of what datatype to return. The better the return type is specified, the more useful the ai helper’s response.\nI run the analysis below. This analysis costs about 40 cents to run with current token rates for the openai api for gpt-4o.\n\nlibrary(ellmer)\n\nget_gpt_summary = \n  function(text){\n    \n    type_summary &lt;- type_object(\n      \"Summary of hearing.\",\n      name = type_string(\"Name.\"),\n      num_attended = type_integer(\"Number of congress people in attendance.\"),\n      num_reps = type_integer(\"Number of republican congress people in attendance.\"),\n      num_dems = type_integer(\"Number of democrat congress people in attendance.\"),\n      topics = type_enum(\n        'Topic of the hearing',\n      values = c(\n        \"Environment\",\n        \"Immigration\",\n        \"Law Enforcement\",\n        \"Emergency Response\",\n        \"Agriculture\",\n        \"Housing\",\n        \"Technology\",\n        \"Business\"),\n      ),\n      summary = type_string(\"Summary of the hearing. 100 words max.\")\n    )\n    \n    type_hearings_summary &lt;- type_array(items = type_summary)\n    \n    chat &lt;- chat_openai(\n      system_prompt = \"You are a chatbot that summarizes congressional hearings.\"\n    )\n    \n    response = chat$extract_data(text[1], type = type_hearings_summary)\n    \n    return(response)\n  }\n\n\nout_df = \n    pdf_df %&gt;% \n    transmute(responses = \n                map(text, get_gpt_summary,\n                    .progress = TRUE))\n\n\n\nResults\nNow that the chatbot has been able to read the text of the pdfs and return answers for each function call, the results just need to be unnested into a dataframe.\n\nlibrary(gt)\n\nWarning: package 'gt' was built under R version 4.4.2\n\nlibrary(gtExtras)\n\nWarning: package 'gtExtras' was built under R version 4.4.2\n\nout_df %&gt;% \n  unnest_wider(responses) %&gt;% \n  gt() %&gt;% \n  tab_header(title = \"U.S. Congressional Hearings\",\n             subtitle = \"AI summary of hearings based on pdf text extracted from the U.S. Government API\") %&gt;% \n  tab_spanner(label = \"Attendance\",\n              columns = num_attended:num_dems) %&gt;% \n  cols_label(num_attended=\"total\",\n             num_reps=\"republicans\",\n             num_dems=\"democrats\",\n             topics=\"topic\") %&gt;% \n  cols_width(name ~ px(70),\n             num_reps ~ px(90),\n             num_dems ~ px(90),\n             num_attended ~ px(50),\n             topics ~ px(90)) %&gt;% \n  gt_theme_538()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Congressional Hearings\n\n\nAI summary of hearings based on pdf text extracted from the U.S. Government API\n\n\nname\n\nAttendance\n\ntopic\nsummary\n\n\ntotal\nrepublicans\ndemocrats\n\n\n\n\nChief Moore\n10\n7\n3\nEnvironment\nChief Randy Moore testified before the subcommittee on the U.S. Forest Service's FY 2025 budget request. Despite receiving increased funding, the Forest Service plans to reduce timber harvesting targets due to challenges like litigation. The hearing addressed the need for improved management to handle wildfires and forest health. Moore emphasized progress in reducing wildfire risks and the importance of maintaining funded initiatives. Concerns included missed targets and underfunding critical programs like hazardous fuels reduction. Ongoing challenges include regulatory barriers and the need for sustainable funding and increased staffing.\n\n\nSAFEGUARDING WORKERS’ RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES\n20\n12\n8\nBusiness\nThe hearing focused on the proposed National Right to Work Act, which would restrict compulsory union membership and dues payment as employment conditions. Republican members advocated for the bill, highlighting the economic growth in right-to-work states and the importance of personal freedom. Democrats opposed the bill, citing the benefits unions offer, such as higher wages and better working conditions. Witnesses shared personal experiences of union membership, with some advocating for the right to refuse union dues, while others stressed union gains in labor rights and benefits.\n\n\nSubcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies – American Indian and Alaska Native Programs Hearing.\n10\n6\n4\nEnvironment\nThe Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies held a hearing focused on American Indian and Alaska Native programs, discussing key issues like mining reclamation, law enforcement funding deficits, and environmental impacts affecting tribes. Witnesses emphasized the needs for increased support and funding to manage these indigenous communities' critical programs more effectively. The session highlighted recurring challenges such as environmental degradation from historical mining, jurisdictional issues in law enforcement, and insufficient Federal commitments to treaty obligations.\n\n\nOversight of the Department of Transportation’s Policies and Programs and Fiscal Year 2025 Budget Request\n60\n33\n27\nTechnology\nDuring the hearing on the oversight of the Department of Transportation's policies and programs, Secretary Pete Buttigieg discussed efforts to address infrastructure and transportation challenges, including the funding and progress of projects under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL). There was discussion on issues like the appeal of a court ruling on the Federal Highway Administration’s emissions performance measure, and concerns regarding marijuana testing regulations for commercial drivers. Secretary Buttigieg emphasized continued infrastructure improvements across the U.S. and the importance of rail and road safety.\n\n\nSECURITY RISK: THE UNPRECEDENTED SURGE IN CHINESE ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION\n10\n5\n5\nImmigration\nThe hearing before the Subcommittee on Oversight, Investigations, and Accountability examined the surge in illegal immigration by Chinese nationals across the U.S. southern border. Witnesses testified that this increase could pose national security risks and is partly driven by China's economic instability and political repression, as well as organized smuggling operations. Discussion also highlighted the lack of comprehensive vetting processes and China's limited cooperation in repatriating its nationals. Members expressed concerns about potential espionage and the need for legislative actions to address these challenges effectively.\n\n\nHousing Unaffordability Hearing\n13\n6\n7\nHousing\nThe Senate Budget Committee hearing focused on the economic risks of housing unaffordability. Witnesses discussed the pressing need for increased housing production to address shortages that drive up costs. Several strategies were explored, including tax credits, reducing regulatory barriers, and leveraging surplus federal lands. The complexities of housing finance were also highlighted, emphasizing the need for more liquidity. Speaker Joseph Shekarchi showcased Rhode Island's initiatives, stressing the importance of bipartisan support and federal partnership in resolving the crisis. The overarching sentiment was that both state and federal efforts are essential to improve housing affordability.\n\n\nFIGHTING FRAUD: HOW SCAMMERS ARE STEALING FROM OLDER ADULTS HEARING\n7\n4\n3\nLaw Enforcement\nThe hearing focused on how scammers are targeting older adults, particularly through sophisticated scams involving technology, like phishing and tech-support scams. Witnesses, including representatives from AARP and law enforcement, discussed the rising trends in financial and emotional impacts these scams have on seniors, highlighting the need for better fraud prevention education, tighter regulations on cryptographic transactions, and stronger law enforcement collaboration. Recommendations included greater public education, industry accountability, and changes in the law to allow tax relief for fraud victims.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow the reader has a succinct summary of each hearing and can perform analysis on attendance by topic in order to derive which topics may be the most important to the congress.\nModifying the return types further would provide a clearer look at which topics congress discusses. If the programmer prudently limits the options the chatbot picks from then a stronger, more informative pattern could be found."
