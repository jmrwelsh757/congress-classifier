KEY MESSAGES • Despite receiving billions of dollars in recent years, the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) is still struggling to confront the myriad challenges facing the agency, most notably the historic wildfire crisis that has destroyed lives and property, degraded air and water quality, and irreparably damaged millions of acres of wildlife habitat. • The USFS budget once again fails to address systemic impediments to addressing the wildfire crisis, while seeking significant increases in funding. Burdensome regulations and frivolous litigation remain the primary obstacles blocking better forest management outcomes. • This hearing will provide an opportunity to hold the USFS accountable and get answers on the agency’s plans to confront our nation’s wildfire crisis, increase timber production, improve forest health, reduce the deferred main- tenance backlog, and address the effects of Biden’s border security failures on our nation’s forests. II. WITNESSES • Mr. Randy Moore, Chief, U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC. III. BACKGROUND Budget Overview—Chief Randy Moore will be appearing before the Subcommittee on Federal Lands to discuss the Biden administration’s fiscal year (FY) 2025 budget request for the U.S. Forest Service (USFS). The USFS’s FY 2025 budget requests $8.9 billion in discretionary funding (including roughly $2.4 billion for the Wildfire Suppression Operations Reserve Fund), which reflects a $658 million increase over (v)vi FY 2024 enacted levels.1 The USFS manages 193 million acres of National Forest System (NFS) lands, including 154 National Forests and 20 National Grasslands across 9 USFS Regions.2 Most of these lands are located in our western states. The USFS manages more federal land in the eastern United States than all the other land management agencies combined.3 Under the Multiple Use and Sustained Yield Act, NFS lands are to be managed for timber production, outdoor recreation, energy and mineral development, livestock grazing, watershed protection, and wildlife habi- tat.4 Every year, NFS lands host roughly 159 million visitors, contributing about $15.2 billion to the nation’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP).5 1 U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Forest Service, ‘‘Fiscal Year 2025 Budget Justification’’, https://www.fs.usda.gov/sites/default/files/fs-fy25-congressional-budget-justification.pdf. 2 Katie Hoover, et al., ‘‘Federal Lands and Related Resources: Overview and Selected Issues for the 118th Congress,’’ Congressional Research Service, February 24, 2023, https:// www.crs.gov/Reports/R43429.

In the past decade, however, the country has now hit that ominous mark three times during the worst wildfire seasons on record (2015, 2017, and 2020).7 This crisis has wreaked havoc on landscapes and commu- nities across the western United States. Catastrophic wildfires destroyed lives and property, degraded air and water quality, and irreparably damaged millions of acres of wildlife habitat. This year, more than 1.86 million acres have burned, largely in Texas and Oklahoma during February wildfires.8 Historically, the USFS has carried out only 2 million acres of treatments per year.9 At this disappointing rate, it would take the USFS over 30 years to treat the estimated 63 million acres of NFS land at risk for wildfire.10 Despite receiving roughly $11.5 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), the USFS has failed to meaningfully ramp up the number of acres treated.11 In fact, for the second year in a row, the USFS budget proposes treating fewer acres than the year prior. The FY 2025 budget seeks $207 million for hazardous fuels reduction, consistent with the FY 2024 enacted amount.12 Although the request for funding is constant, the USFS treat- ment goal for FY 2025 is 4 million acres, or 200,000 acres less than the previous year’s target.13 This puts the agency off by roughly 2 million acres from their own estimates regarding how much land needs to be treated in the 10-year ‘‘Confronting the Wildfire Crisis’’ Strategy.14 6 NIFC, ‘‘Wildfires and Acres, https://www.nifc.gov/fire-information/statistics/wildfires. 7 Id. 8 National Interagency Fire Center, ‘‘National Fire News’’, https://www.nifc.gov/fire- information/nfn. 9 PERC, ‘‘Does Environmental Review Worsen the Wildfire Crisis’’, Eric Edwards, Sara Sutherland, June 14, 2022, https://perc.org/2022/06/14/does-environmental-review-worsen-the- wildfire-crisis/. 10 Katie Hoover & Anne A.

The House Committee on Natural Resources has advanced legislation to address inaccurate reporting of treated acres by USFS. H.R. 1567, introduced by Subcommittee on Federal Lands Chairman Tom Tiffany (R-WI), requires the Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Department of the Interior to submit accurate reports regarding hazardous fuels reduction activity and implement stand- ardized procedures for tracking data related to such activities. The legislation was reported by the Committee on Natural Resources by unanimous consent on April 28, 2023, and was passed by the House of Representatives by a vote of 406 to 4 on September 13, 2023. Wildland Fire Management—As wildfire seasons have grown in both length and severity, so too have wildland fire management costs. In the last decade, suppres- sion costs averaged over $3 billion per year across the federal land management agencies.16 The FY 2025 budget proposes $2.6 billion for Wildland Fire Management activities, an increase of $433 million from the FY 2024 enacted level.17 Unfortunately, the FY 2025 budget proposes shifting more than half of that total— approximately $1.3 billion designated for wildfire pre-suppression and suppression activities and firefighter salaries—from base discretionary to emergency funding.18 In so doing, the FY 2025 budget would free up base discretionary funding for pet projects of the Biden Administration, including the purchase of zero-emission vehi- cles and associated charging infrastructure.19 This budgetary gimmick would divert funding from necessary wildfire management activities and appears to be an attempted evasion of effective congressional oversight and responsible budgeting practices. 15 NBC News, ‘‘The Forest Service is overstating its wildfire prevention progress to Congress despite decades of warning not to’’, Adiel Kaplan, Monica Hersher, August 9, 2022, https:// www.nbcnews.com/news/investigations/forest-service-overstating-wildfire-prevention-progress- congress-decad-rcna41576. 16 U.S. Forest Service, ‘‘Economic risks: Forest Service estimates costs of fighting wildfires in a hotter future’’, Sarah Farmer and Jenni Moore Myers, May 14, 2024, https://www.fs.usda.gov/ features/economic-risks-forest-service-estimates-costs-fighting-wildfires-hotter-future#:∼:text= Wildfire%20suppression%20is%20costly.,than%20%243%20billion%20per%20year. 17 U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Forest Service, ‘‘Fiscal Year 2025 Budget Justifica- tion’’, https://www.fs.usda.gov/sites/default/files/fs-fy25-congressional-budget-justification.pdf. 18 Id. 19 Id.ix Timber Targets—The USFS failed to hit its timber target in FY 2024 by roughly 260 million board feet, selling only 3.143 billion board feet (BBF).20 Concerningly, the USFS lowered its timber target from 3.4 BBF to 3.2 BBF for the next two years.21 This troubling trajectory for treatment and timber targets casts doubt on the USFS’s wildfire risk reduction efforts and reflects an ongoing threat to sawmill infrastructure. Since 2000, over 1,500 sawmills, or roughly one-third of the total number of sawmills in operation at that time, have closed or curtailed capacity.22 The loss of this critically important infrastructure and mill capacity greatly hampers efforts to process hazardous fuels, thus exacerbating the wildfire crisis. A lack of reliable federal timber is consistently cited as a primary cause behind numerous mill closures in western states with large amounts of federal land. Just last month, in April 2024, C&D Lumber, which began operations in southern Oregon in 1890, announced its permanent closure, citing ‘‘timber supply issues’’ among other chal- lenges, that ‘‘have made it impossible for us to envision a sustainable future for the company.’’ 23 Without a stable supply of timber, investments in new sawmills, which often cost more than $100 million, make little sense for private industry.24 The FY 2025 Budget includes $43 million to support Forest Products, and the USFS has contin- ued to emphasize its support to expand markets for through Wood Innovations grants. Last year, USFS used $48 million to fund 104 Wood Innovations projects focused on expanding wood products and markets.25 While innovative uses for wood products are an important pursuit, they are not a replacement for the Forest Service’s need to do a better job harvesting timber resources to meet the market’s current demands. Wildfire Prevention Studies—Despite heightened federal expenditures on suppres- sion activities, wildfires continue to increase in size and severity across the U.S.26 Investments in wildfire prevention, including through scientific studies of at-risk 20 Id. 21 Id. 22 Congressional Budget Office, ‘‘Wildfires’’, June 2022, https://www.cbo.gov/publication/58212. 23 KQEN News Radio, ‘‘C&D Lumber Announces Permanent Closure’’, April 5, 2024, https:// kqennewsradio.com/2024/04/05/cd-lumber-announces-permanent-closure/. 24 The Advocate, ‘‘More than half a billion investment in sawmills planned across Louisiana amid higher lumber prices’’, Kristen Mosbrucker, July 26, 2021, https://www.theadvocate.com/ acadiana/news/business/more-than-half-a-billion-investment-in-sawmills-planned-across- louisiana-amid-higher-lumber-prices/article—600c8bac-ee3e-11eb-8075-cbf03f7e098e.html. 25 U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Forest Service, ‘‘Fiscal Year 2025 Budget Justifica- tion’’, https://www.fs.usda.gov/sites/default/files/fs-fy25-congressional-budget-justification.pdf.uyk 26 Jessica Blackband, ‘‘Firefighting Workforce Benefits From FY25 Budget Request But Sustained Investments Are Necessary To Address The Wildfire Crisis,’’ Federation of American Scientists, April 16, 2024, https://fas.org/publication/fy25-wildfire-budget/.x landscapes, are a crucial step toward addressing the growing crisis.27 Unfortunately, the USFS FY 2025 budget request, while proposing significant funding increases for other budget items, misses opportunities to sustain needed prevention efforts. The Joint Fire Science Program (JFSP), for example, ‘‘provides funding and science delivery for scientific studies associated with managing wildland fire, fuels, and fire- impacted ecosystems to respond to emerging needs of wildland fire and land man- agers, practitioners, and policymakers from local to national levels.’’ 28 As such, the JFSP aims to function as a ‘‘primary clearinghouse’’ for cutting-edge ‘‘fire science information and activities throughout the nation.’’ 29 Although this program prom- ises many prevention-related benefits, the USFS proposes to cut funding for the JFSP for FY 2025.30 State, Private, and Tribal Forestry—Wildfires do not respect manmade bound- aries, so collaboration with states, tribes, local communities, and other stakeholders is critical. The State, Private, and Tribal Forestry organization within the USFS facilitates much of this cross-boundary work.31 This organization provides resources and assistance to non-federal stakeholders, focusing on improving forest health and protecting communities from wildfires.32 The FY 2025 budget decreases that account by roughly $32 million, dropping by $305 million below FY 2024.33 Reforestation—In addition to addressing existing wildfire threats, there is a clear need to restore previous landscapes damaged by wildfire. In the last 20 years, the United States lost an average of 7 million acres per year to catastrophic wildfires, more than double the average seen during the 1990’s.34 Many of these catastrophic wildfires burn so severely that natural regeneration is impossible. If these lands are not artificially regenerated (i.e., by planting trees), the lands will eventually transi- tion from forests to shrublands. In total, the USFS identified a 4 million-acre refor- estation backlog, 80 percent of which is related to catastrophic wildfires.35 Unfortunately, the agency has only addressed less than 6 percent of its post-wildfire planting needs annually.36 The IIJA removed the $30 million cap on the Reforest- ation Trust Fund (RTF), which receives funds from the collection of tariffs on cer- tain wood-product imports to fund reforestation efforts on public lands.37 The USFS budget notes that collections decreased to $158 million from $261 million in FY 2024.38 The budget seeks $140 million to increase ‘‘organizational capacity in nursery, genetics, and reforestation programs.’’ 39 Even though the USFS is requesting additional money for reforestation, the agency’s reforested acreage target is lowered in the FY 2025 budget. The USFS aims to complete roughly 1.8 million acres of reforestation over the next 10 years.40 Despite the considerable increase in funding through the RTF, this reforestation goal is a decrease from before the cap was removed when the agency was averaging reforestation on 190,000 acres annually.41 More needs to be done to address the esti- mated 4-million-acre reforestation backlog.42 Further, while reforestation is an important component of healthy forest management, failing to properly thin and manage forests and utilize wood products will mean that replanted trees will add fuel to future wildfires. 27 Id. 28 U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Forest Service, ‘‘Fiscal Year 2025 Budget Justifica- tion’’, https://www.fs.usda.gov/sites/default/files/fs-fy25-congressional-budget-justification.pdf. 29 Id. 30 Id. 31 U.S. Forest Service, ‘‘State, Private, and Tribal Forestry’’, https://www.fs.usda.gov/about- agency/state-private-forestry 32 Id. 33 Id. 34 Congressional Research Service, ‘‘Wildfire Statistics’’, Katie Hoover, June 1, 2023, https:// www.crs.gov/Reports/ IF10244?source=search&guid=b82a4d954677449b918a65ece823396f&index=0. 35 U.S. Forest Service, ‘‘Reforestation Strategy,’’ July 2022, https://www.fs.usda.gov/sites/ default/files/fs_media/fs_document/Reforestation-Strategy.pdf. 36 Id. 37 Id. 38 U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Forest Service, ‘‘Fiscal Year 2025 Budget Justifica- tion’’, https://www.fs.usda.gov/sites/default/files/fs-fy25-congressional-budget-justification.pdf. 39 Id. 40 Id. 41 U.S. Forest Service, ‘‘Reforestation Strategy,’’ July 2022, https://www.fs.usda.gov/sites/ default/files/fs—media/fs_document/Reforestation-Strategy.pdf. 42 U.S. Forest Service, ‘‘American Forests Partners with USDA Forest Service to Expand Reforestation across National Forests’’, https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2023/12/06/ american-forests-partners-usda-forest-service-expand-reforestation.xi Wildland Firefighter Pay—The IIJA provided $600 million to increase the base firefighter salary by $20,000 (or 50 percent of their current salary, whichever is lesser).43 Under the IIJA, $480 million of this increase was for the USFS wildland firefighters, while $120 million was for the Department of the Interior (DOI).44 Congress has extended this pay increase four times, and the current extension will last through the end of FY 2024.45 To address wildland firefighter pay, the USFS FY 2025 budget includes $2.6 billion for Wildland Fire Management Activities, a $433 million increase from the FY 2024 level.46 The budget also includes $216 million for a permanent pay increase for wildland firefighters.47 An increase of $69 million is requested for cost of living adjustments, and $136 million to increase Federal firefighting capacity.48 Finally, this budget seeks a $10 million investment to support health and wellbeing services for wildland firefighters.49 Brave wildland firefighters, who routinely put their safety and lives on the line to protect vulnerable communities, undoubtedly deserve fair compensation. Unfortu- nately, the USFS has consistently failed to transparently account for salaries and expenses, complicating this issue. The FY 2025 budget fails once again to identify an offset for any pay increases and suggests in numerous instances that the agency may not even have enough money to pay normal salaries. For example, the budget frequently states: ‘‘The Forest Service will need to rely on other funding sources for Salaries and Expenses and balance hiring actions and attrition rates to stay within appropriations in the operational year.’’ 50 The budget does not provide any further analysis to accompany this vague statement, causing confusion about whether the agency may need to request supplemental funds to continue normal operations. This curious lack of detail compounds previous concerns raised by Congress that the USFS had inaccurately asserted wildland firefighters would face a pay cut when the agency had over $100 million remaining to pay firefighter salaries.51 Old Growth and Mature Forests—In April 2022, President Biden issued Executive Order 14072, directing the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and DOI to define, identify, and inventory ‘‘mature and old growth forests’’ on public lands and subsequently develop policies to protect those forests.52 The interagency mature and old growth initiative began in July 2022 with a Federal Register Notice and public comment period, resulting in roughly 4,000 comments and more than 100,000 signa- tures on various form letters from across the country.53 In April 2023, the USFS published an ‘‘initial draft’’ seeking to define and inventory ‘‘old-growth and mature forests’’ and even convened a ‘‘Definition Development Team.’’ 54 Yet all these efforts have failed to create a single, coherent definition for ‘‘old-growth’’ or ‘‘mature’’ forests. This is a predictable shortcoming, as no standard definition exists for ‘‘old- growth forests’’ and ‘‘mature forests,’’ and they are not terms recognized in the scientific practice of forestry. Despite this lack of clear definitions, the report identi- fied 91 million acres of ‘‘old-growth and mature’’ forested lands on NFS lands, comprising 63 percent of all land managed by the USFS.55 43 U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Forest Service, ‘‘Update: Wildland firefighter pay, classification in infrastructure law’’, https://www.fs.usda.gov/inside-fs/delivering-mission/excel/ wildland-firefighter-pay-classification-infrastructure-law. 44 Id. 45 U.S. Forest Service, ‘‘March 2024 firefighter pay, series update’’, March 25, 2024, https:// www.fs.usda.gov/inside-fs/delivering-mission/excel/firefighter-pay. 46 U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Forest Service, ‘‘Fiscal Year 2025 Budget Justifica- tion’’, https://www.fs.usda.gov/sites/default/files/fs-fy25-congressional-budget-justification.pdf. 47 Id. 48 Id. 49 Id. 50 Id. 291-37. 51 Thomas Catenacci, ‘‘Biden admin caught pushing misleading narrative on dire budget warnings impacting firefighters, data shows,’’ Fox News, September 22, 2023, https://www. foxnews.com/politics/biden-admin-caught-pushing-misleading-narrative-dire-budget-firefighters- data. 52 Executive Office of the President [Joseph Biden].

This forest plan amendment process to protect so- called ‘‘old growth forests’’ poses serious threats to forest health and multiple use management. Committee Republicans are continuing to fight against this unnecessary and unhelpful endeavor. 30x30 Initiative and Locking Up Lands—The Biden administration continues to conduct orchestrated attacks on public lands, using a variety of tools to further the 30x30 agenda. These preservationist policies limit access, hurt local economies, and remove uses of public lands that benefit Americans. The Biden budget continues to support the 30x30 Initiative, including through several references in the USFS budget.60 On May 6, 2021, the USDA and other federal departments released an ‘‘interim’’ report titled ‘‘Conserving and Restoring America the Beautiful,’’ which outlined a 10-year campaign to preserve 30 percent of U.S. lands and waters by 2030.61 In this report, the administration proposed an American Conservation and Stewardship Atlas. Nearly three years later, the administration finally published this atlas, even though the USFS has already been implementing 30x30 without clear goals or definitions and in whatever manner it considers convenient on any given day.62 For instance, the decision to lock-up roughly 16.7 million acres under roadless restrictions in the Tongass National Forest in Alaska has been highlighted as an advancement for 30x30. Likewise, the misguided 225,000-acre mineral with- drawal in the Superior National Forest in Minnesota was touted as a win for the so-called ‘‘America the Beautiful Initiative.’’ These measures continually threaten working lands, private landowners, and multiple uses of land. Great American Outdoors Act (GAOA)—Since the passage of the GAOA in 2020, the USFS received up to $285 million from the National Parks and Public Lands Legacy Restoration Fund (LRF) each year to address the deferred maintenance backlog.63 Despite this significant investment, the USFS’s deferred maintenance backlog increased from $5.22 billion in FY 2019 to over $7.66 billion in FY 2022.64 While this increase is not as large as those experienced by agencies like the National Park Service, it still represents an astonishing 47 percent increase over a relatively short period. The FY 2025 budget requests $285 million for 89 LRF 56 Id. 57 U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management, ‘‘Analysis of Threats to Mature and Old-Growth Forests on Lands Managed by the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management, January 2024, https://www.fs.usda.gov/sites/default/files/fs_media/fs_document/MOG-Threats- Intro.pdf. 58 U.S. Forest Service, ‘‘Land Management Plan Direction for Old-Growth Forest Conditions Across the National Forest System, December 20, 2023, 88 FR 88042, https:// www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/12/20/2023-27875/land-management-plan-direction-for- old-growth-forest-conditions-across-the-national-forest-system. 59 U.S. Forest Service, ‘‘National Old-Growth Amendment’’, https://www.fs.usda.gov/managing- land/old-growth-forests/amendment#:∼:text=The%20National%20Old%2DGrowth%20Amendment ,to%20rapidly%20changing%20climate%20conditions. 60 U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Forest Service, ‘‘Fiscal Year 2025 Budget Justifica- tion’’, https://www.fs.usda.gov/sites/default/files/fs-fy25-congressional-budget-justification.pdf. 61 U.S. Department of the Interior, et al., ‘‘Conserving and Restoring America the Beautiful,’’ 2021, https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/report-conserving-and-restoring-america-the- beautiful-2021.pdf. 62 American Conservation and Stewardship Atlas, launched April 19, 2024, https:// www.conservation.gov/pages/atlas-and-data. 63 U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Forest Service, ‘‘FAQs-Great American Outdoors Act’’, https://www.fs.usda.gov/managing-land/gaoa/faqs. 64 Congressional Research Service, ‘‘Deferred Maintenance of Federal Land Management Agencies: FY2013-FY2022 Estimates and Issues’’ Carol Hardy Vincent, August 8, 2023, https:// crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R43997.xiii projects. Of this amount, $33.86 million is for administrative and contingency funds, which will do nothing to reduce the maintenance backlog.65 The FY 2025 budget request also includes $218 million for the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), which covers $123.8 million for land acquisition and $94.2 million for the Forest Legacy Program.66 Last year, the USFS acquired over 46,000 acres of land.67 Despite this permanent and mandatory funding stream, the discretionary USFS budget continues to carry a specific line item for land acquisi- tion above LWCF funding. Adding new acres to the federal estate for the USFS to manage while the agency’s deferred maintenance backlog steadily rises will only exacerbate existing maintenance challenges. Biden Border Crisis—The Biden Border Crisis is harming USFS lands, primarily through the illegal cultivation of narcotics on USFS lands by drug cartels. The USFS reported that 5,801 illegal cannabis cultivation sites were detected on NFS lands during the 2011–2022 period.68 While data is limited, the USFS estimated that it had removed 381,510 pounds of trash, 479 miles of plastic irrigation lines, and 228 containers of banned and illegal pesticides from these illegal cultivation sites over a roughly 20-year period.69 This illegal cultivation also sparked wildfires that burned over 265,000 acres.70 The USFS estimated that illegal marijuana cul- tivation on National Forest System lands earns cartels an estimated $56 million to $91 million annually.71 Even the USFS’s own budget documents acknowledge that the agency has historically been ‘‘underestimating the threat of this activity on Federal public lands’’ and only capturing a mere fraction of the illicit activity occur- ring on NFS lands.72 For example, the USFS used new technology to survey a mere four percent of three National Forests and found 136 cultivation sites.73 Of these sites, 77 had gone completely undetected over the previous 20 years.74 Despite the promise of this new technology, the budget does not specifically ask for any related increases to address President Biden’s border crisis. In fact, the only increases related to border enforcement are for updated vehicles. With each officer of the USFS’s Law Enforcement and Investigations program patrolling, on average, a sprawling 370,000 acres of NFS lands,75 investments in enforcement technology and personnel are sorely needed. 65 U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Forest Service, ‘‘Fiscal Year 2025 Budget Justifica- tion’’, https://www.fs.usda.gov/sites/default/files/fs-fy25-congressional-budget-justification.pdf. 66 Id. 67 Id. 68 Response to questions for the record submitted by Chairman Westerman.

Tom Tiffany [Chairman of the Subcommittee] presiding. Present: Representatives Tiffany, McClintock, Fulcher, Stauber, Curtis, Bentz, Westerman; Kamlager-Dove, and Leger Fernández. Also present: Representatives LaMalfa; and Stansbury. Mr. TIFFANY. The Subcommittee on Federal Lands will come to order. Without objection, the Chair is authorized to declare a recess of the Subcommittee at any time. The Subcommittee is meeting today to hear testimony on the President’s Fiscal Year 2025 budget request for the U.S. Forest Service. I ask unanimous consent that the following Members be allowed to participate in today’s hearing from the dais: the gentleman from California, Mr. LaMalfa. Without objection, so ordered. Under Committee Rule 4(f), any oral opening statements at hearings are limited to the Chairman and the Ranking Minority Member. I, therefore, ask unanimous consent that all other Members’ opening statements be made part of the hearing record if they are submitted in accordance with Committee Rule 3(o). Without objection, so ordered. I now recognize myself for an opening statement. STATEMENT OF THE HON. TOM TIFFANY, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF WISCONSIN Mr. TIFFANY. I would like to begin by welcoming Chief Moore back before the Subcommittee. Chief Moore, it is good to have you here again. We appreciate you taking the time to answer our questions on your agency’s Fiscal Year 2025 budget request. Improving the health of our nation’s forests and combating the devastating wildfire crisis are some of the most pressing issues before this Committee. The scale of this challenge is immense and cannot be overstated. For far too long communities, particularly those out West, have had to bear the brunt of catastrophic wildfire for years with seemingly no end in sight. Unfortunately, the Forest Service’s Fiscal Year 2025 budget fails to rise to meet this challenge. (1)2 Due to reckless Democratic spending during the previous Congress, the Forest Service received roughly $11.5 billion in sup- plemental funding. This funding was touted as transformative and the only tool the agency needed to increase the pace and scale of forest management. Years later, it is hard to see any difference this funding has made on the ground. For the second year in a row, the Forest Service budget proposes treating fewer acres than the year before, with a target of 4 million acres treated. Based on the agency’s own estimates, this puts the Forest Service roughly 2 million acres behind the goals they laid out in the 10-year wildlife crisis strategy. As we know from previous investigative reporting and Committee oversight, these numbers are still likely inflated due to Forest Service’s policies of counting acres treated more than once. I am happy that my bipartisan ACRES Act passed the House last year, and I hope the Senate can consider this legislation quickly. However, I am still disappointed that this issue even requires legis- lation to fix. Chief Moore, the American people deserve transparency and accountability, and I would strongly encourage your agency to improve the quality of this data. Concerningly, the number of acres treated is not the only Forest Service target that is being missed. Last year, the Forest Service also fell short of its timber harvest targets by roughly 260 million acres. And once again, this budget has lowered the timber targets from 3.4 billion board feet to 3.2 billion board feet for the next 2 years. [Chart.] Mr. TIFFANY. Throughout this Congress I have often shown the chart behind me, which demonstrates the relationship between fail- ing to harvest timber and catastrophic wildfires. There is a direct relationship between our continuing failure to harvest timber and the historically catastrophic wildfire years we are experiencing. It is therefore deeply troubling that, instead of attempting to remedy the shortcomings of failing to meet the agency’s target this year, the Forest Service has apparently chosen to lower its timber target by 400 million board feet. This is not walking down the right path to forest restoration. We have heard from our land managers, including Chief Moore, about the need for a paradigm shift in the way we manage our forests. I agree. But it continues to be abundantly clear that funding alone will not deliver this shift, and we must address the regulatory and litigation obstacles that continue to impede management efforts. This budget once again seeks more funding to do less manage- ment, while also failing to offer any reforms to address long- standing barriers to forest management. I am rightfully skeptical. While I have concerns with this proposed budget, I do recognize the enormous challenges facing the Forest Service, and hope that we can discuss ways to bring about the changes to see better results. There is broad agreement on the need to turn the tide against this wildfire crisis and restore health and resiliency to our ailing forests. We also know that we need to aggressively suppress wildfires threatening our communities, take care of our brave wildland3 firefighters in a fiscally responsible manner, and support our local forest products industry. I want to once again thank Chief Randy Moore for being here today. We are committed to working with you and your agency on these solutions, and we look forward to hearing more from you today. With that, I now yield back and recognize Ranking Member Kamlager-Dove for her opening statement. STATEMENT OF THE HON. SYDNEY KAMLAGER-DOVE, A REP- RESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Ms. KAMLAGER-DOVE. Thank you, Chair Tiffany and Chief Moore. You are back before us again in the Federal Lands Subcommittee, and I look forward to the conversation today. Your time is valuable. We know this. And as we enter this year’s fire season, I would like to offer my sincere gratitude for the work that you and your agency do each and every day, especially for Californians and Angelenos. The Forest Service is charged with sustaining the health, diver- sity, and productivity of the nation’s forests and grasslands to meet the needs of present and future generations. That is no small task, as the nation’s forests and grasslands make up 193 million acres nationwide. And last month was the hottest May on record and the 12th consecutive month to claim that title. Let me repeat that: 12 straight months of record highs. A full calendar of record busting temperatures, and not just in the House Oversight Committee. This is unprecedented, and should be indisputable affirmation that climate change is affecting our public lands. Such drastic climate changes make the work of the Forest Service ever more complex and essential as fire seasons rage longer, drought intensifies, and our forests face considerable resil- iency obstacles. So, it would make sense to me that we would be aiming to meet the Forest Service’s budget requests, fully fund their vital mitigation and response accounts, amplify the innova- tive work being done to modernize forest products, and ensure that the agency has significant support for staffing and capacity chal- lenges. After all, that is how you help government work. Unfortunately, we have continued to see a cycle of chronic and unsustainable underfunding for the agency, underfunding and then blame gaming. In fact, just a few months ago the Chief warned us that lower appropriated funds, required cost-of-living adjustments, and inflated costs of operation are leading to funding gaps in sala- ries and other internal services among the Forest Service. We must listen to our agency leaders when they express such significant concerns. Democrats delivered with monumental investments from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act, which have certainly helped. I know that the firefighter pay in- crease from the infrastructure law has been an important hiring and retention tool for the Forest Service, and I am pleased to see $216 million in the Fiscal Year 2025 budget to continue this initia- tive, one which we must make permanent.4 Despite the gains from these investments, the Forest Service still faces vacancies in fire-related positions and general staffing gaps in non-fire positions. Such gaps directly tie to project delays and management challenges across the agency that my Republican counterparts often attribute to the legal burdens of environmental review. However, we know that reviewing, permitting, and project man- agement activities require staff capacity more than anything to execute the tools we have already granted the Forest Service, tools such as the 12 new authorities Congress has passed in the last 10 years meant to reduce the permitting process or the role of judicial review in the project approval proposal. The Forest Service doesn’t need new authority or additional waivers of our bedrock environmental laws. It needs sustainable funding and additional staff capacity. It is promising to see a prioritization from the Biden administration to address staffing challenges across the agency to support a growing demand for out- door recreation, restoration projects aimed at adapting to a changing climate, protection of cultural resources, and providing clean water resources nationwide. Chief Moore, I look forward to hearing from you and listening to our discussion today. I hope that my colleagues and I can work together to support a beneficial and strong Forest Service budget for Fiscal Year 2025. With that, I yield back. Mr. TIFFANY. Thank you, Representative Kamlager-Dove. Now, I am going to recognize the Chairman of the Full Committee, Mr. Westerman, if he is ready for his opening statement. Sir, are you prepared? Mr. WESTERMAN. Always prepared, Mr. Chairman. [Laughter.] STATEMENT OF THE HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN, A REP- RESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ARKANSAS Mr. WESTERMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chief Moore, thank you for being here today. It has been good to work with you and visit with you and to understand the chal- lenges that forestry and America face, and I know you are on the front lines of that. It is something I am very passionate about. But as we look at the budget request from this year and we see the in- crease, I think you can understand why we have some heartburn when you look at the history of the funding that we have sent to the Forest Service. When I first came to Congress, the big issue was fire funding. And we did the fire funding fix. And then we did the Great American Outdoors Act, and included the Forest Service in the Great American Outdoors Act. There was the Bipartisan Infra- structure Law of 2021 that gave more money to the Forest Service. I did not vote for that one. I did not vote for the Inflation Reduction Act. But all of those bills put more funding into the Forest Service. And it doesn’t appear that anything is getting better with the health of our forests across the country.5 And I know you face a lot of challenges, and a lot of that is because of Congress, and because we have failed to give you the tools and the authorities to be able to go in and do the work that you need to do. And we are in a situation now that you and I have discussed, where it is kind of a triage mode. There are a limited number of resources, there are a limited number of people who can do management. And the areas that seem most critical to protect are those wildland-urban interfaces, their transportation corridors, transmission corridors, watersheds. And it is almost like, I will use the term ‘‘the troops,’’ that are out there to manage the forests are retreating back to these areas and trying to create the last defense against catastrophic wildfire, and this is something that has come about because of years of not being able to manage the rest of the forests. And we know that to be able to manage forests, we have to have markets for the products. Mr. McClintock has had success in passing legislation that has been very beneficial down around South Lake Tahoe in doing man- agement that has stopped wildfire, yet there are hardly any markets for those products that come off, and it ends up costing the taxpayer a thousand to a couple thousand dollars an acre to be able to go in and manage the forests simply because the mill infrastruc- ture is not there that was once available. And we have seen that in many places in the West. And being from Arkansas, where we have a vibrant forest prod- ucts economy, and I know you are from Louisiana, where they have the same, my constituents probably don’t understand, nor should they have to understand why we have to spend Federal dollars to be able to do management on the forests. That is a foreign concept because, usually, when you do management on the forests, it gen- erates revenue to not only pay for itself but to go back into the landowners’ pockets, which in this case is the Treasury and the taxpayer. And there was one time in the history of this country where the Forest Service actually put more money back into the Treasury than it cost to run the Forest Service. We are not anywhere remotely even close to that anymore, and we are seeing the levels of fire danger increase. We are seeing the amount of land that is subject to catastrophic wildfire increase. We are seeing more mills close, and the train is going in the wrong direction. I know that you know this, I know this, and we ought to be able to work together to figure out how to turn the train around and make America’s forests all that they should be. I look forward to hearing your testimony and to having a dialogue about how we can work together to use the resources that we have to create a better situation for America’s forests, which means creating a better situ- ation for America’s wildlife, for America’s air quality, for America’s water quality, and all the other benefits that go with a healthy forest. With that, I yield back. Mr. TIFFANY. Thank you, Chairman Westerman. We will now move on to witness testimony.6 Let me remind the witness that under Committee Rules, you must limit your oral statement to 5 minutes, but your entire state- ment will appear in the hearing record. To begin your testimony, please press the ‘‘on’’ button on the microphone. We use timing lights. When you begin, the light will turn green. At the end of 5 minutes, the light will turn red. I would like to introduce Mr. Randy Moore, Chief of the U.S. Forest Service. Chief Moore, you are recognized for 5 minutes. STATEMENT OF RANDY MOORE, CHIEF, U.S. FOREST SERVICE, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, WASHINGTON, DC Mr. MOORE. Thank you, Chair Tiffany, Ranking Member Kamlager-Dove, and the members of the Subcommittee. Thank you for inviting me to testify today. We are grateful for your continued support. The President’s budget names three primary goals for us: to modernize wildland fire management, to sustain investments crit- ical to our mission, and to ensure equitable access and benefits to Americans. Today, I will share our progress as we put money to work to confront serious challenges. I will share how our work will continue to be a sound investment. We directly steward about 193 million acres of National Forest System lands. We reach across boundaries to assist states, tribes, communities, and private landowners to keep millions more acres of healthy forests productive. Every American benefits from these forests, directly or indirectly. Together these lands provide basic needs for life, clean air and water, while they contribute to energy production and support local economies. National forests alone con- tribute more than 410,000 jobs and $44.3 billion to the gross domestic product. To sustain productivity and health, forests must be able to with- stand threats posed by wildfire, climate change, drought, insects, and disease, and on and on. We invested resources to act and ensure that they do just that. Foremost, we prioritize work to reduce wildfire risk, safeguard communities, and create resilient forests. In 2022, we launched a 10-year Wildfire Crisis Strategy and we moved to implement it. Annual appropriations, coupled with the historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act, provided an extraordinary opportunity to take bold and stra- tegic actions. We did just that. We progressed to deliver on a prom- ise to increase the pace and scale of our treatments. We are not just treating any acre, we are treating the right acres in the right places and at the right scale. We focused initial efforts on 21 priority landscapes within Western firesheds at the highest risk. They account for roughly 80 percent of wildfire risk. These investments are paying dividends. Experts reported roughly $700 billion worth of housing and infrastructure are at risk within these priority landscapes. This includes $6.5 billion of mu- nicipal watersheds which supply drinking water to 12 million peo- ple. In the last 2 years, we reduced the average wildfire risk to these assets by 8 percent for infrastructure, 8 percent for housing,7 and 12 percent for watersheds. That means that we protected more than $300 million worth of homes at risk. In the Stanislaus National Forest, for example, 17 communities are at lower risk, including towns of Cold Springs and Strawberry. A million socially vulnerable people are at less risk. Nearly half of national forest lands and priority landscapes are now considered unlikely to burn at high intensity. We must remain on course and build on these gains. We recognize the urgency of investing in a permanent and a com- prehensive pay increase to provide a more livable wage, enhance recruitment, and stabilize retention. We must also improve housing conditions and provide better care for our firefighters’ physical and mental health. We look forward to seeing an end to reports of fire- fighters living in cars with few benefits and limited mental health care. In addition to work to address the wildfire crisis and firefighters, we continue to take action that supports access and benefits from forests. Visitor use, hunting and fishing, energy and minerals development, forest products, and livestock grazing generate 69 percent of the contributions to the economy. Thanks to the Great American Outdoors Act funds, we relieved some of the pressures from the $8.6 billion of backlog that we have. The budget requests $58 million to maintain critical recreation services, with a focus on offering welcoming and equitable opportunities. We are also making a difference in our urban environments. The Forest Service and partners are planting and maintaining trees in cities and areas where 84 percent of Americans live. Trees combat extreme heat and climate change, and they also improve access to nature. The 2025 budget returns basic funding to most programs. This includes forest products, which are vital to sustaining rural com- munities. This includes sustainable timber supply. We know it is a critical component and is part of a complex, market-driven system. And while we don’t control markets, we can support indus- try through forest products and wood innovations which help mills adapt and modernize. And while the current industry adapts, the agency has taken strides to support the existing industry by invest- ing nearly $80 million over the last 3 years in directly supporting sawmills and other forest products manufacturing facilities. We have also expanded the wood basket for mills through the build and timber transport program, and authorized extensions to timber sale contracts to provide relief from the decline in the demand for paper products. In closing, we are fully committed to meeting the challenges before us with the resources Congress provided. The people of America deserve nothing less than to see their money put to work to benefit all. Thank you, and I welcome your comments. [The prepared statement of Mr. Moore follows:]8 PREPARED STATEMENT OF RANDY MOORE, CHIEF, USDA FOREST SERVICE Chair Tiffany, Ranking Member Neguse, and members of the Subcommittee, thank you for inviting me here today to testify on the President’s fiscal year (FY) 2025 Budget request for the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Forest Service. The fiscal year 2025 President’s Budget for the USDA Forest Service discretionary appropriations totals $6.5 billion for base programs and $2.4 billion for the wildfire suppression cap adjustment (through the Wildfire Suppression Operations Reserve Fund). The fiscal year 2025 Budget focuses on three primary areas: modernizing the wildland fire management workforce; sustaining the foundational investments crit- ical to the mission of the Forest Service; and ensuring equitable access to and benefits from the National Forest System. America’s forests provide timber, clean air and water, forage, and energy produc- tion. They support local economies through employment, trade, recreation, tourism, green jobs, and livestock grazing. They host and protect sites and landscapes of high cultural, spiritual, or recreational value. These benefits are at risk from wildfires, pests, diseases, invasive species, and drought, all of which are exacerbated by climate change. It is vital to continue to act now to mitigate these threats and pro- tect our resources. Alongside our partners, the Forest Service will continue to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires to communities in FY 2025 through investments in the wildland fire management workforce and throughout the high-priority land- scapes identified within the agency’s 10-year Wildfire Crisis Strategy. The invest- ments highlighted below reflect services the Forest Service delivers through work on National Forests, partnerships with State, Private, and Tribal landowners, and our Research and Development mission area. These investments enable the Forest Service to restore long-term forest health and resiliency across landscapes the American people rely on while ensuring equitable access to the resources on National Forest System lands. Recent analysis shows that in FY 2022, Forest Service programs and work contributed approximately 410,400 jobs (average of annual full-time, part-time, tem- porary, and seasonal) and $44.3 billion in Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Recreational visitor use, hunting and fishing, energy and minerals development, forest products, and livestock grazing generated 69 percent of the economic activity. The Forest Service continues to be a good place to invest and will maximize every dollar invested into our agency, making every dollar work for the American people. The citizens we serve deserve nothing less than to see the value of their money at work for their benefit. The President’s FY 2025 Budget Request for Specific Priorities The following investments align with and enhance the agency’s efforts to modernize and invest in our wildland fire management workforce: • The 2025 Budget proposes $2.6 billion for base Wildland Fire Management activities, investing in firefighter compensation, benefits, mental health, and wellbeing, and supporting the objectives of the agency’s 10-year Wildfire Crisis Strategy. o Provides $216 million to implement a permanent, comprehensive pay increase for the wildland firefighter workforce, providing a more equitable wage, enhancing recruitment, and stabilizing retention. o $136 million for additional federal firefighting capacity (570 more permanent firefighters and continued transition to a more full-time work- force) to enable the Forest Service to more effectively meet the demands of the increasingly year-round wildfire season, while improving the work-life balance of firefighters and support personnel. o $10 million for mental health and well-being assistance to ensure our wildfire firefighter workforce are supported in managing the mental and physical aspects of their mission. • In addition, the Budget proposes $25 million to address the urgent need for suitable employee housing through necessary maintenance and repairs of Forest Service housing units.9 The 2025 Budget proposes to fund the National Forest System at $2 billion, prioritizing recreation service delivery, climate smart land management, forest prod- ucts, law enforcement, and the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program, while maintaining foundational hazardous fuels treatments to reduce wildfire risk: • $207 million for Hazardous Fuels Reduction: to return to previously enacted program levels and mitigate wildfire risk on 4.0 million acres with a focus on high-priority and high-risk firesheds, building on hazardous fuels funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act, and in aligning with the agency’s 10-Year Wildfire Crisis Strategy. • $58 million for Recreation, Heritage, and Wilderness: to provide critical recreation operations, planning, services, and improvements, with particular emphasis on creating welcoming, sustainable, and equitable recreation oppor- tunities for all Americans with a focus toward underserved and Tribal communities. • $41 million for Forest Products: to support the foundational funding needed to maintain the Forest Service’s ability to sell timber, which can be a critical component to sustaining local rural communities. • $33 million for Vegetation and Watershed Management: to provide support for healthy and resilient watersheds and landscapes, sustain the pro- duction of clean and abundant air and water, assist with meeting the Administration’s climate goals, and contribute to healthy and productive com- munities and Tribal Nations. • $34 million for Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program: to invest in communities and regions with a collaborative, common purpose in reducing wildfire risk and improving forest health and resiliency. • $21 million for Law Enforcement Operations: to provide critical law enforcement response for the prevention, detection, and criminal investigation of violations of Federal laws and regulations for the protection of visitors to National Forest System lands, Forest Service employees, and natural and cultural resources. • $1.5 billion for National Forest System Salaries and Expenses: to main- tain the workforce needed to support the agency programs critical for forest health and resiliency, which complement the 10-Year Wildfire Crisis Strategy. Further investments ensure that the Forest Service relies on the latest science and technology to deliver results on the ground and for the people: • $470 million for Information Technology Capabilities: continue mod- ernization of our Information Technology systems that allow the public to better access our services, sustain emergency communication systems, and provide our workforce the tools they need to carry out our conservation mission. • $316 million for Forest and Rangeland Research: continue investments in research priorities, with a focus on climate change-related research including reforestation, carbon accounting, and fire and fuels research. These investments continue to build on the historic investments provided by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) (P.L. 117-58) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) (P.L. 117-169). The Forest Service will continue to strengthen our long- standing work and relationships with States, Tribes, local communities, private landowners, and other stakeholders to adapt lessons learned into a coordinated and effective program of work to improve the resiliency of landscapes and watersheds, reduce wildfire risk, protect and maintain infrastructure, support outdoor recre- ation, establish tree canopy in nature-deprived communities, and invest in the reforestation of America’s impacted landscapes. The Forest Service cannot succeed in this work alone, especially when addressing the firesheds highest at risk, which are typically in multiple ownerships. Through meaningful communication, expanded partnerships, and broader community sup- port, the Forest Service will increase the use of prescribed fire and other fuel treat- ments and the management of unplanned ignitions to reduce long-term wildfire risks. Fortunately, we have decades of experience working through partnerships and collaboration based on common values and shared goals across shared landscapes as set out over 20 years ago in the National Cohesive Wildland Fire Management Strategy.10 Ensuring Equitable Access to and Benefits from the National Forest System The Forest Service remains unwavering in its commitment to the values of equity, inclusion, and equal opportunities for its employees and the public it serves. The Forest Service maintains the intent to focus on prioritizing activities that will pro- vide benefits to disadvantaged or underserved communities. The Forest Service vows to proactively engage in actions that ensure a safe, resilient, and harassment- free work culture where employees are treated with respect and dignity. The Forest Service will continue to invest in actions that facilitate access to the vital resources our forests and grasslands provide. This effort is twofold. First, we must ensure that those who rely on these services and benefits can access those benefits safely. Therefore, we are committed to improving the operation and mainte- nance of our extensive infrastructure portfolio that includes buildings, dams, com- munication sites, recreation sites, roads, trails, and bridges. Second, to carry out this work effectively, the Forest Service is committed to continued intentional inter- nal and external engagement with Tribal Nations and communities that live by, visit, and depend on national forests. The Forest Service is committed to identifying and removing barriers to access Forest Service programs and services for histori- cally underserved communities. This will be done by integrating equity-centered criteria in the design, funding, and prioritization of all policies, programs, and activities to center equity considerations as part of the decision process. The Forest Service will also work to remove barriers and boost economic opportunities through improved access to contracts, grants and agreements, and permits. Leveraging Additional Funding Authorities It is expected that by FY 2025, much of the funding from the IRA will have been invested, but along with the tools and investments proposed in the FY2025 Presidents Budget, the Forest Service will continue to leverage funding within the BIL to combat climate change and confront the wildfire crisis, create new markets and technology for wood products, and restore forest health and resiliency through partnerships and collaboration across landscapes. The BIL provided $1.4 billion for hazardous fuels treatments, while the Inflation Reduction Act provided an additional $1.8 billion for hazardous fuels work within the wildland urban interface. In February, we announced $500 million for FY 2024 to expand work on the Forest Service’s strategy to reduce the risk to communities, critical infrastructure and forests from the nation’s growing wildfire crisis. From 2022–2024, we have invested a combined $1.6 billion in the 21 high-priority land- scapes identified under the agency’s 10-Year Wildfire Crisis Strategy as we continue moving these landscapes toward a maintenance state. These investments will help reduce the risk of wildfire to communities, Tribal lands, ecosystems, and critical infrastructure, including utility corridors and public water sources. Our work under the 10-Year Wildfire Crisis Strategy provides many values the public depends on and cares about including beginning to reduce risk to approximately 550 commu- nities, of which 475 are underserved; 2,500 miles of power lines; and 1,800 municipal watersheds. Through Great American Outdoors Act (GAOA) (P.L. 116-152) funding, the Forest Service continues to repair and upgrade vital infrastructure and facilities in the national forests and grasslands through the National Parks and Public Land Legacy Restoration Fund (GAOA-LRF). In both FY 2024 and 2025, increased emphasis was given to using GAOA-LRF funding to address deferred maintenance on Forest Service-owned housing units as one step toward helping our employees confront the housing availability and affordability crisis in this country. In addition to the $40 million Congress approved in FY 2024, we are proposing another $30 million in housing-related GAOA-LRF projects to address this critical need. It is estimated that in FY 2025, GAOA-LRF projects at FS will contribute 3,200 jobs and $360 million in GDP. In closing, the President’s FY 2025 Budget request for the Forest Service proposes a landmark investment that reflects the Administration’s ongoing commitment to building and sustaining a robust and resilient Federal wildland fire management workforce, maintains funding priorities for risk-based wildfire reduction, and improves overall access to and utilization of our National Forests System. The FY 2025 Budget request also highlights the importance of restoring and creating resil- ient landscapes, improving infrastructure, and removing barriers to access. We look forward to working with this Subcommittee to fulfill the President’s goals and our key responsibilities for the long-term benefit of the Nation’s forests and grasslands, and for all Americans. I will be glad to answer your questions.11 QUESTIONS SUBMITTED FOR THE RECORD TO THE HONORABLE RANDY MOORE, CHIEF, U.S. FOREST SERVICE The Honorable Randy Moore did not submit responses to the Committee by the appropriate deadline for inclusion in the printed record. Questions Submitted by Representative Westerman Question 1. During the hearing, Representative Stauber asked about a ‘‘temporary’’ cap on backcountry permits in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area. In response, you said: ‘‘So we are currently working with the local community to do just what you described. To date we have not made a lot of progress, but I would be willing to get back with you by the week’s end to give you more specifics on what we have been able to do within the community.’’ 1a) Did you get back with Representative Stauber by week’s end? 1b) If not, why not? 1c) Will you commit to lifting the ‘‘temporary’’ cap on backcountry permits in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area? 1d) What progress has the Forest Service made in reopening our national forests and ensuring we return to pre-pandemic levels of access? Question 2. This committee has deep concerns with the Biden administration’s dis- proportionate focus on protecting so-called ‘‘old-growth’’ and ‘‘mature’’ forests, not least because it diverts agency efforts from addressing the wildfire crisis and because such terms are poorly defined. Yet the Forest Service recently published a Notice of Intent to amend all 128 national forest land management plans to provide direction on how to manage, conserve, and steward ‘‘old-growth’’ forest conditions. 2a) In general, how long have forest plan revisions taken to complete in the last 5 years? 2b) How long is the process of amending all 128 forest plans expected to take? 2c) Please provide an estimate of the total hours that the Forest Service’s staff has already spent and plans to continue spending on this ‘‘old-growth’’ amendment process. 2d) Absent this focus on ‘‘old-growth,’’ would Forest Service staff have more time to spend working on wildfire risk-reduction and NEPA-compliant forest management projects? Question 3. In January 2024, the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Manage- ment (BLM) released an introductory report that identified wildfire, insects, and dis- eases as the leading threats to ‘‘mature and old-growth’’ forests and even admitted that ‘‘tree cutting’’ is a minor threat that generally ‘‘improved or maintained’’ the stands that had been managed. Given these findings, should the Forest Service instead focus on expanding its forest treatment efforts? Question 4. The 2012 Planning Rule consciously chose to leave old growth issues to the individual plan development process, rather than promulgating national standards or guidelines for old growth. 4a) What changed between the adoption of the 2012 Planning Rule and April of 2021 when President Biden signed the Executive Order on Old Growth that made a single national approach the correct one? 4b) You were regional forester in Region 9 when this took place. Do you believe the Forest plans adopted in Region 9 when you were regional forester were adequately or inadequately protective of old growth? 4c) Can you provide the committee with information regarding whether old growth has increased or decreased in the region since 2009 when the forest plans were last revised? Question 5. You mentioned that there is a large amount of timber under contract that has not yet been cut. Can you please provide the committee with the following information: 5a) The volume under contract for as many previous fiscal years as possible, but at least the last 10 years.12 5b) The type of timber under contract—sawtimber, pulpwood, biomass, other convertible, etc. 5c) The volume of timber under contract but either under injunction or withdrawn due to litigation, by Forest Service region. Question 6. Can you provide the committee with a breakdown of the amount of volume under litigation by Forest Service Region? Question 7. Chief Moore, during the hearing, there were several discrepancies regarding the amount of timber sold by the Forest Service in recent years. Please pro- vide the amount sold annually, in billion board feet (BBF), by the Forest Service for the past 10 fiscal years. Question 8. Does the Forest Service count personal use firewood as a timber accomplishment? If yes, has this always been the case? Question 9. How much has personal use firewood contributed to timber outputs during the past four years? Question 10. How many fuel breaks have been established under the categorical exclusion that was created by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act? 10a) Where are these fuel breaks located? 10b) How many total acres do they cover? 10c) Did the Forest Service use commercial timber harvest to establish any of these fuel breaks? If so, please identify them. Question 11. The committee has learned that of roughly 55 wood product facility closures in the last several years, 21 of them were in close proximity to the National Forest System. 11a) Do you believe that the Forest Service should be striving to keep these facili- ties operating, so that they can help provide a market for wood products on the National Forest System? 11b) If so, what is the agency doing to prevent future closures of wood products facilities? Question 12. Across the country, timber mills are shutting down or significantly curtailing operations due to a lack of reliable timber supply. Congress has tried to assist by giving your agency tools like 20-year stewardship contracting authority, but the Forest Service has failed to fully utilize that tool. Given that your agency is plan- ning to reduce timber harvesting levels, what concrete steps can the Forest Service take to sustain and expand forest products infrastructure? Question 13. During questioning from Representative Pete Stauber, you said that the Forest Service would have met its Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 timber-harvesting goal ‘‘but for litigation.’’ 13a) Please provide a list of all litigation that prevented the Forest Service from reaching this target. 13b) Please provide an estimate of the amount of timber, in BBF, that each lawsuit or settlement cited above prevented from being harvested in FY 2023. Question 14. The Forest Service has lowered its timber-harvesting goal from 3.4 BBF in FY 2023 to 3.2 BBF for both FY 2024 and FY 2025. 14a) Is the Forest Service currently on track to meet this reduced goal for FY 2024? If not, why not? 14b) Did the Forest Service lower these goals at least partially as a response to ongoing or anticipated litigation? 14c) If so, please provide a list of all litigation that influenced this determination. Question 15. The partial fix to the Cottonwood decision expired in March 2023. Please describe the effects that the Cottonwood decision, and litigation generally, con- tinue to have on the Forest Service’s ability to actively manage our nation’s forests.13 Question 16. Road access is especially important in those U.S. Forest Service lands that are located near and along the U.S.-Mexico border. A few years ago, I toured the Coronado National Forest in Arizona with CBP officials who stated that the inability to build proper access roads diminished agent mobility and reduced the effectiveness of border enforcement measures. This, in turn, poses dangers to officer safety when they must engage in the pursuit or apprehension of suspected perpetrators. 16a) Will you commit to supporting the construction of more roads on Forest Service lands along the southern border to protect our law enforcement officers and increase operational control of the border? 16b) Have you had any discussions with Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas—or any top Homeland Security officials—about how to address these challenges? Question 17. President Biden’s open-border policy has contributed to increased drug trafficking and cultivation on federal lands. The Forest Service recently detected more than 5,800 illegal cannabis cultivation sites within our national forests. Since illegal cultivation activities have sparked massive wildfires, their growing presence on national forest lands remains a serious concern. In fact, in this year’s budget request, the Forest Service admits that it has ‘‘likely underestimat[ed] the threat of [marijuana cultivation] activity on Federal public lands.’’ 17a) What concrete steps is the Forest Service taking to reduce illegal drug production in national forests? 17b) This year’s budget request explains that when the Forest Service recently used new technology to survey a mere 4 percent of only 3 national forests, it found 77 illegal drug cartel cultivation sites that had gone undetected for 20 years. Given that this alarming figure pertains to just a fraction of our national forests, does the Forest Service plan to expand this kind of surveillance? Question 18. The Forest Service budget requested decreased funding for the Joint Fire Science Program, which funds scientific studies on managing wildland fires. Why is this program being cut, while other budget items that are wholly unrelated to forest health are receiving increases? Question 19. How many miles of road has the Forest Service decommissioned per year from FY 2004 to FY 2024? Please break down the annual figures by state, region, or both. Question 20. How many miles of road will the Forest Service decommission pursu- ant to the FY 2025 budget? Please break down this figure by state, region, or both. Question 21. In response to Chairman Tiffany’s question, ‘‘What is a green job?’’ you replied that a green job is a job that involves ‘‘working with the environment to keep it healthy and resilient.’’ 21a) Earlier in the hearing, you stated that timber harvesting is ‘‘necessary’’ for effective forest management and reducing wildfire risk. By this logic, should timber- harvesting jobs qualify as ‘‘green jobs’’? 21b) If not, why not? Question 22. The Forest Service has reduced its forest treatment goal for this year to just 4 million acres, which—by the agency’s own estimates—is inadequate for con- fronting the nation’s current wildfire risk. I’m concerned that the Forest Service is now shifting the goalposts to ‘‘outcome-based’’ metrics when, just a few short years ago, your agency—not Congress—set acreage-based targets. The Forest Service has also received $11.5 billion in taxpayer funding to achieve this goal of treating 20 million acres in 10 years. 22a) How are we supposed to hold the agency accountable if we’re not measuring progress based on acres treated? 22b) How is this change in metrics consistent with the 10-year Wildfire Strategy? Question 23. Wildfires do not respect administrative boundaries, which is why col- laboration with states, Tribes, and other stakeholders is crucial for fire prevention. Within the Forest Service, the State, Private and Tribal Forestry organization is tasked with facilitating much of this needed cross-boundary work. The FY 2025 budget, however, decreases funding for that account by roughly $32 million.14 The Wildland Fire Mitigation and Management Commission’s most recent report found that federal agencies must do more to engage tribes in meaningful co- management agreements. So, why is this funding being reduced? Question 24. President Biden’s 30x30 Initiative is often described as a campaign to conserve 30 percent of U.S. lands and waters by 2030. Critically, however, the administration has failed to make clear what counts as conservation. For example, on the newly created conservation.gov, the administration lists most National Forest System land as not contributing, or only pending additions, to the national conserva- tion goals. 24a) Does the Forest Service share the view, apparently held by the Biden adminis- tration, that most of the National Forest System lands are insufficiently conserved? i) If so, please explain why. ii) If not, please explain why not. Question 25. There is broad international and domestic consensus about the carbon benefits of using more wood products in construction. In fact, at the December 2023 COP 28 summit in Dubai, the U.S. and 16 other countries agreed to increase sustain- able forestry and the use of wood products in construction as ‘‘a vital decarbonization strategy.’’ However, the U.S. currently imports about one third of its lumber. The Forest Service manages about 188 million acres of national forests, including some of the most productive forests in the world, but provides very little of our demand for lumber and other wood products. Do you believe that the Forest Service has a responsibility to sustainably manage a portion of its lands in a manner that meets some of our need for carbon friendly wood products? Question 26. The Forest Service provides several important reports for tracking the agency’s timber sale program and harvest trends, including the ‘‘Forest Products Cut and Sold report,’’ ‘‘Periodic Timber Sale Accomplishment Reports,’’ and ‘‘Harvest Trends on National Forest System Lands.’’ The most recent data available in the ‘‘Harvest Trends on National Forest System Lands’’ report is from 2021. Please provide an updated version of this report and make this updated report available to the public on the Forest Service website. Questions Submitted by Representative Fulcher Just recently the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) forecasted a very high risk for wildfires in the West this year. Low precipitation combined with a high fuel mix creates a chal- lenging problem for rural communities and the electric utilities that serve them. Electric cooperatives in my state are doing everything within their power to mitigate wildfire risk but extreme weather conditions remain an uncertainty and are ulti- mately hard to plan for because of the unknowns. These utilities are not for profit and all additional costs are borne by their customers. Unfortunately, I understand the USFS is looking to charge utilities with power line corridors through their lands nearly $3 million per fire incident for strict liabil- ity damages. Smaller, rural electric cooperatives and the communities they serve can- not bear this level of damages. Already these utilities are finding it difficult to obtain wildfire insurance. This level of damage would bankrupt these utilities. I’m curious about your authority to unilaterally increase strict liability damages for powerline corridors. Question 1. Could you confirm that this is accurate, and if so, will you work with my office to collaborate with utilities on this matter? Question 2. Under what authority can the USFS charge strict liability damages and how does the agency justify this one-size-fits all level of damages? Questions Submitted by Representative Stauber Question 1. Please provide an estimate of the number of acres of National Forests within the state of Minnesota would be covered by the old growth plan amendment, and specifically the number of acres that are needed to satisfy the requirements laid out in the Service’s Notice of Intent (NOI) to provide for ‘‘connectivity, ‘‘recruitment,’’ and ‘‘adjacency’’ in old growth management.15 Question 2. As you state during the hearing, prescribed fires are only one of the many critical tools used to prevent catastrophic fire on our nation’s public and pri- vate lands. Last May, the EPA finalized a new ambient air quantity standard for fine particulate matter, otherwise known as PM2.5 NAAQS. 2a) Can the Committee assume that the recent PM 2.5 NAAQS ruling will have zero impact on federal, state, and private land managers’ ability to utilize controlled burns to safely manage our nation’s forests? 2b) As states develop implementation plans to meet EPA’s new standard, how will USDA and EPA work collaboratively to ensure that the states implementing the new standard do not remove this critical fire prevention tool? 2c) Further, because fire doesn’t know boundaries between federal and private lands and since private lands represent approximately 70% of total working forest acres, how is USDA working to ensure that all forests retain this critical manage- ment tool? 2d) Is the agency concerned about the impact the PM 2.55 NAAQS ruling will have on the future success of wood products market development, and if so, how is the Agency working to ensure that rural economic health and public health can be achieved cooperatively? Question 3. The inflation reduction act (IRA) directed the General Services Admin- istration (GSA) to acquire and install materials that have substantially lower levels of embodied greenhouse gas emissions, as determined by the EPA. In response, EPA developed a low embodied pilot program and interim determination that prioritized concrete, glass, asphalt, and steel as qualifying for the allocated IRA funding. Prod- ucts with lower embodied carbon, including bio-based materials, were segregated into a separate category for ‘‘further exploration,’’ and tasked among others, USFS for de- veloping guidance to support the purchase of bio-based materials, including wood products. 3a) Your agency continues to invest in wood products through programs like the Wood Innovation Grant Program and the Community Wood Facility Grant Program. What steps has USFS taken to develop guidance per EPA’s request? Question 4. One of the most effective ways to reduce embodied carbon in buildings is to build with wood products. Structural wood products do not require the same energy intensive manufacturing process that is common for other building materials. Additionally, wood products are unique in the fact that they store carbon—these materials are approximately 50% carbon by dry weight. 4a) Given this, why has this administration chosen to prioritize concrete, glass, asphalt, and steel? 4b) Given USFS’s investment into wood products, has your agency made any effort to ensure that wood products included in administration policies which purport to lower carbon? Question 5. On March 9, 2023, the Forest Service proposed changes to its cost recovery regulations pertaining to Land Uses; Special Uses; Strict Liability Limit and Insurance. The agency proposed dramatically raising cost recovery fees for special use permits in the first four categories of cost recovery, eliminating the cur- rent 50-hour exemption for outdoor recreation permits. The 50-hour exemption was first implemented in 2006 in the final cost recovery rule to lessen the impact on small entities. The proposed rule increases cost recovery fees starting at $255 for less than 8 hours of work and up to $3,313 for processing costs that require between 40 and 64 hours. The final rule has not been published in the Federal Register. 5a) Is the Forest Service still planning to totally eliminate the exemption for the first 50 hours of work? 5b) There are no refunds for categories 1 through 4 even if the agency does not respond or complete the work paid for under cost recovery. Are you planning to modify that portion of the rule to provide a refund if the agency fails to act? 5c) Is the pre-decisional objection process for project-level actions subject to cost recovery? 5d) When does the Forest Service expect to publish the final cost recovery rule? Question 6. The Forest Service has been encouraged to look at the expansion of categorical exclusions (CATEX’s) for routine special recreation permit re-issuance. The agency has made some progress in implementing CATEX’s for ministerial permit16 renewal. However, in designated wilderness, we are faced with hurdles outside the NEPA process, such as the Minimum Requirements Analysis (MRA) for activities that are prohibited in the wilderness but which may be necessary to fulfill the pur- poses of the Act. Some so-called ‘‘non-conforming’’ uses are authorized by Congress when a Wilderness is designated. An example would be the authorization for motor- boat towing service in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. 6a) Does the MRA apply to these congressionally authorized uses? 6b) Are there additional categorical exclusions and streamlining actions the agency can take to improve the efficiency of issuing recreational special use permits? Question 7. In the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, the Superior National Forest imposed a ‘‘temporary’’ cap on backcountry permits at 80% of the previous cap in response to increased use during the COVID–19 pandemic. When will this temporary cap be lifted? Question 8. The Forest Service is revising SUDS, a web-based application used by Special Uses administrators to authorize permit leases and easements, amend these authorizations, and track billing information in the Recreation and Lands Programs. Program managers use the system to collect, analyze, maintain, and track data about special use permits and revenue, including data about land use and cost recovery. 8a) What is the status of that revision, how much does it cost, and when do you expect it to be launched? 8b) Are there any issues complicating SUDS implementation? 8c) Will these changes interrupt the processing of special use permit applications? Mr. TIFFANY. Thank you, Chief Moore, for your testimony. We really appreciate that you are here today. And I will now recognize Members for 5 minutes. We are going to take a couple rounds of questioning here before we break for votes. I recognize the gentleman from Minnesota for 5 minutes. Mr. STAUBER. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Chief Moore, thank you once again for coming before the Subcommittee. Despite dramatic budget increases in Fiscal Year 2022 and 2023, we are seeing reduced access to outdoor recreation and diminished public benefits across the National Forest System. This has been evident in the Superior National Forest in northern Minnesota, for example. In the Boundary Waters Canoe Area a ‘‘temporary cap on backcountry permits,’’ equal to 80 percent of their previous cap, was put in place in response to increased demand and use during the COVID-19 pandemic. During that time campsites in the BWCA were also closed, but many of those campsites still have not re- opened today. Clearly, these caps are not temporary. What progress has the Forest Service made in reopening our national forests and ensuring we return to pre-pandemic levels of access? Mr. MOORE. Thank you for that question, Congressman. We are currently working with the local community to do just what you described. To date, we have not made a lot of progress, but I would be willing to get back with you by the week’s end to give you more specifics on what we have been able to do within the community. Mr. STAUBER. Thank you. The Service is largely reliant on a Ticketmaster-style online permit registration system involving a17 mad dash to compete for a limited number of permits when they are released. Oftentimes, people buy up large blocks of permits that often go unused. And I recognize this isn’t just an issue for the BWCA or the Superior National Forest or the Forest Service. That said, what specifically is the Forest Service doing to address this? Mr. MOORE. First of all, we want to be able to really understand what is going on. And we are trying to be responsive to what peo- ple are choosing to do by buying up blocks. So, we are looking into it to see what opportunities we have to limit what we see hap- pening across that whole system. And to date, I don’t have any news to report to you in terms of the progress that we have made on that. Mr. STAUBER. Chief, are you looking to limit the big blocks of buying the permits for entry? Is that what you just said? Mr. MOORE. We are going to be looking at all of it, including the big blocks. Mr. STAUBER. OK. Well, let me ask you this. Would increasing the number of available permits and returning to pre-pandemic levels of access help alleviate this issue or make it worse? Mr. MOORE. Yes, I think it would, Congressman. Mr. STAUBER. Changing gears a bit, would you consider timber harvesting to be an important tool for the Forest Service to protect against wildfire risk? Mr. MOORE. Yes, timber is a necessary tool. Mr. STAUBER. In Fiscal Year 2024, the Forest Service missed its timber harvesting target by approximately 260 million board feet. That includes missing the mark on forests like the Chippewa and Superior National Forests. You missed your 3.4 billion board feet goal by over 7.5 percent, almost 8 percent. How does missing this timber harvesting goal affect the forest system’s wildfire risk? Mr. MOORE. Congressman, one of the challenges we have is liti- gation. And if you look at the amount of litigation we have with our problems, we would have exceeded our timber targets. We have no control over that part of it. We just have to deal with it. Our plan was to meet or exceed our targets. We would have done that, but for the litigation that we are currently under. Mr. STAUBER. The weaponizing of the court system is what you are saying? Mr. MOORE. I am saying that we would have met our targets, but for litigation. Mr. STAUBER. The Service has lowered its timber harvesting goal from 3.4 billion board feet to 3.2 billion board feet for the next 2 years. If the Forest Service is aiming to harvest 200 million less board feet of timber over the next year, how do you plan to address this delta in terms of the wildfire risk? Mr. MOORE. Well, actually, for the last 20 years, our timber har- vesting has gone up. In fact, if I look at the last 20 years, we have increased our timber harvesting by roughly 30 percent. I am not really sure about the numbers that you are spouting, but I would be happy to meet with you separately to look at the numbers that you have, and where you got those numbers from, and compare to what we are showing in our books.18 Mr. STAUBER. We got them from the professionals in the Forest Service. And thanks in large part to the decreased availability of timber from Federal lands, mills across this country are closing, including several in my district, that have led to layoffs for hundreds of employees. And given that many of our national forests are working indus- trial forests, does the Forest Service take into consideration lost economic activity when it makes decisions that limit responsible industrial use of our forests? Mr. MOORE. Yes, Congressman. I mean, any time a mill closes, it hurts us, as well. And many of our employees have grown up and lived in those same communities. Mr. STAUBER. I have 1 second left. I appreciate, Chief Moore, that you said in your comments that you are looking at national forests to produce energy and mineral development. The Superior National Forest is a working industrial forest where mining and timber harvesting are a desired condition. And we want to keep that just as it is. Thank you very much. I yield back, Mr. Chair. Mr. TIFFANY. Yes, I just add to the gentleman from Minnesota we have talked to the Chief offline here. We want to see those numbers where they are saying that those harvest levels have actually gone up. We want to look at them in the long term as well as the short term. And we will be working with members of the Committee and with the Chief to compare those numbers and see where the differences lie. Mr. STAUBER. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Mr. TIFFANY. I would now like to recognize the Ranking Member, Ms. Kamlager-Dove, for 5 minutes for her questioning. Ms. KAMLAGER-DOVE. Thank you, Mr. Chair. And thank you, Chief Moore, for your testimony. I just want to add that a Fiscal Year 2022 economic analysis found, actually, that the U.S. fire service programs contributed $44.3 billion in gross domestic product and contributed 410,000 jobs. I think that is a very strong return on investment for the appropriations that you all have received. Can you share how the Forest Service is addressing the most critical landscapes through the 10-year Wildfire Crisis Strategy and the funding provided from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act? Mr. MOORE. Yes, I would be happy to. The Wildfire Crisis Strategy involves and includes about 21 different landscapes across the West primarily. In those 21 land- scapes, we have identified 550 communities within it, 2,500 miles of utility corridor lines. And we also have about 1,800 municipal or priority watersheds that serve as drinking water for 12 million people. So, in that we are looking at the type of investment that we are making in those landscapes that are so important to the American people. And to date, just in the last 11⁄2 to 2 years of implementa- tion of the Wildfire Crisis Strategy, we reduced the risk to homes by 8 percent. We reduced the risk to utility corridors and that crit- ical infrastructure about another 8 percent. And then, on those19 watersheds that are so important, we reduced the risk there about 12 percent. And you may say, well, what does all of this mean? And what it really means in other terms is that we reduced the risk to about $300 million worth of homes. And we have also reduced the risk to drinking water that serves 12 million people. This is only after the first 11⁄2 years of implementation of the Wildfire Crisis Strategy. And we feel that, with sustained investment, you will continue to see that investment improve $700 billion worth of values just within those 21 landscapes. Ms. KAMLAGER-DOVE. Great. Has funding been dispersed to all 21 landscapes, including identified landscapes in Southern California? Mr. MOORE. Yes. Southern California is one of the landscapes. We also have some in Northern California, and we have them across the West primarily, and we have about $1.8 billion that have been identified to work on that. And we have treated approxi- mately 1 million acres within the 21 landscapes so far. Ms. KAMLAGER-DOVE. Great. And what will happen to your progress treating critical landscapes when the funding runs out? Mr. MOORE. I would like to ask Congress what happens if it runs out, because all of the progress that we are building and creating would be at risk or at jeopardy. Because once we create these con- ditions, what we don’t talk about quite often is maintaining those conditions that we have invested in creating, and it is very critical. Ms. KAMLAGER-DOVE. Yes, thank you. There have been some narratives out there that conservation and climate resilience is a misplaced priority. But the reality is that the investments made possible from those funding bills have allowed the Biden adminis- tration to support sustainable management and restoration where there is an important need to reduce wildfire risk or to restore eco- system integrity. Do you want to add to that? Mr. MOORE. Yes. I can’t underscore the value that both the BIL and IRA legislation has provided the Forest Service in creating and really getting at what we consider the biggest challenges to our forests, which are wildfire, disease, and insects. And there are a lot of reasons for that, but it is something that we continue to fall be- hind because we have not had the resources to address the issues. One example is when we look at the deferred maintenance that we have across the agency, it was at $8.6 billion. With GAOA, it has given us an opportunity to start looking at some of that back- log that we have. And when you look at some of the biggest chal- lenges within that, roads, dams, and bridges create about $5.4 billion of that $8 billion of backlog. Ms. KAMLAGER-DOVE. Thank you. There is also this narrative that you all have still failed to meaningfully ramp up the number of acres treated. But you have said before that the performance is restricted by budget decreases and hazardous fuels reduction, and across-the-board increases of operational costs. In my last few seconds, do you want to add to that? Mr. MOORE. Yes, I think one of the really strategic questions for this Committee and for us as well has to do with how do we report, or what are our performance metrics? Because the way that we have reported over the last 100 years, we need to diversify how and20 what we report if we are going to move into this future that is here. And what I mean by that is not just outputs, but outcomes of the work that we are doing on the landscapes because of the values that it benefits and protects. Ms. KAMLAGER-DOVE. Thank you, I yield back. Mr. TIFFANY. The gentlelady yields. I now recognize the gentleman from Idaho, Mr. Fulcher. Mr. FULCHER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and, Chief Moore, it is a pleasure to see you again. Thank you for being here and for your work. We are clearly here to talk about the proposed budget, but that is directly impacted by the use of resources that your depart- ment impacts. So, I am going to kind of follow a line of discussion in that vein if OK with you. And you are familiar with my state, we have had conversations before. We have about 34 million acres in Idaho that is managed by the Federal Government. And the timber industry is a huge part of that, and a major industry and a major concern for us. And Chairmen Westerman and Tiffany also talked about the clo- sures of mills and whatnot that is having an impact on all of us. We are not immune from that. In fact, just within the last few days, a major mill, Stimson Lumber Company in Idaho, just an- nounced that they will be closing. And I am going to quote the CEO, a part of his statement here. According to the CEO, ‘‘Over time, the supply of the size of timber processes has declined, and so we have had to reduce our production.’’ And if I recall correctly, you have talked in the past, in previous testimony, about the need for low-value materials and markets for those materials. So, I just want to open this up and get your feedback. To me, it is pretty clear that we have an issue of access to sup- ply. That is one component. We have the issue of the processing or the mills. And then we have the issue of the markets. And if our numbers are correct, Chief Moore, about a third, a little less than that, 30 percent of the U.S. supply of lumber, of wood products comes from outside of the United States, with Canada and China being at the top of those import nations. So, from my vantage point, it is not a market issue that we have. It is an access to resource issue that we have. There is not a short- age of timber in Idaho. There is not a shortage of timber in the United States. But there appear to be very significant constraints, and those constraints are shutting our mills down. I just want to open that up, and that is my monologue, but I would like to get your commentary, as well. Mr. MOORE. Yes. Thank you, Congressman. This issue that you raise, you are correct in so many different ways. Some of these things that you may not be aware of, though, are the market condi- tions, because markets are playing a role in this. And to give you an example, I look at just Idaho alone. And in Idaho, as of May 4 this past month, we sold 137 million board feet there. Also, as of May 4 in Idaho, we have about 580 million board feet of timber that has been sold, but not yet cut. So, it is not cut because of market conditions, and it is playing a significant role in——21 Mr. FULCHER. But Chief, if I could just interject for a second, how are Canada and China able to come into our country—maybe not Idaho specific, but into our country—and compete, if that is true? Mr. MOORE. Well, it is true. And we do business with a lot of countries, but I am only giving you the data that I have. And I am saying, if I had to look nationally at that same number, Congress- men, we have 8 billion board feet that have been sold that is not cut. So, there is a lot going on that is not being discussed or talked about, and I think that we need to be really transparent in what is really going on across the country. Because what you are saying is correct, but also what I am saying is correct. And there are con- ditions that we are not talking about that also have a significant role in what is going on across our—— Mr. FULCHER. I know we are out of time, but I really, sincerely want to connect with you and have further conversations, because if there is a scenario where any other country with a product, with the amount of freight involved and processing and whatnot, that can ship to our country and outcompete our domestic sourcing, there is something that has to be looked at that is just not right, that needs attention. And, unfortunately, I think it needs congressional intervention. Mr. MOORE. Yes. Mr. FULCHER. I am out of time. I thank you for your exchange, and I sincerely want to continue this beyond this discussion. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Mr. MOORE. I would love to, by the way. Mr. FULCHER. Thank you. Mr. TIFFANY. The gentleman yields. And as I stated previously, and I am sure the gentleman from Idaho heard that, we are going to be engaging with the Chief offline here, and you are sure wel- come to join us in regards to that. We want to see the numbers that they are producing, as well as the other numbers that are being produced by other folks who follow this very closely. Chief, I hope you can take a little break here, because we do have to cast a couple votes. We will be back here as promptly as possible. The Committee stands in recess. [Recess.] Mr. TIFFANY. The Committee will be in order. I would now like to recognize the gentleman from Colorado for 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. LAMBORN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chief Moore, last year, I asked you questions regarding wildfire, specifically on thinning and fuels management. You concurred that healthy forests should have between 50 to 80 trees per acre, as opposed to 250 to 300 that national forests near my district have. As I said last time, in the fall of 2020, Colorado saw the two largest wildfires in state history: the Cameron Peak Fire and the East Troublesome Fire. Most of these happened on Federal land. Despite robust funding, fuel material continues to pile up on Federal lands. In fact, the Fiscal Year 2025 presidential budget re- quest asks for more money while targeting 200,000 less acres than22 last year. Has there been any change since we spoke on the Forest Service’s position on tree thinning and fuels management? Mr. MOORE. Yes, we are constantly looking at fuels management. And in Colorado, particularly along the Front Range, that is one of our priority landscapes. And we have ramped up treatments in the Front Range landscapes, so we are making, actually, a lot of progress there, Congressman, in terms of what we are able to do in terms of treatments on those landscapes. Mr. LAMBORN. OK, very good. Also, the last time that you were in front of this Committee, you resisted the Forest Service using fuel-related categorical exclusions, and that is why I introduced the Locally-Led Restoration Act to provide flexibility in stewardship contracts while focusing on wildlife mitigation through fuel removal. So, my question is, you mentioned collaborating with community leaders. Please share what conversations, if any, you have had regarding stewardship and timber contracts with industry. Mr. MOORE. We have had a number of memoranda of under- standings and agreements with some of the industry folks. One of the latest ones we have had was with NAFO, the National Association of Forest Owners, and one of the contracts there had to do with the timber owners or the landowners. We have agreed to allow them to jump on a fire if it is in their area during an ini- tial attack. That has been in place for a year now. And we went back and did an after-action review this past winter to look to see if there was any value to that, and we found out, with the timber and forest owners, that there was value. In fact, we saw a couple of fires that they were able to get to that could have grown into larger fires. The other agreement that we have with the industry is to look at opportunities after a fire for reforestation. So, we entered into an agreement, actually, with Sierra Forest Industries. And in that agreement, they have reforested some of the national forest- managed land as they were doing theirs. And I think we had about 120 acres this past year on that. So, we are looking at a lot of different opportunities that partner with industry and other community leaders to look at bringing them into the decision space on what we do out there. Mr. LAMBORN. OK, that is good to see that progress being made. What this bill would do, as I just mentioned, is instead of all-or- nothing contracts, it lets there be a counteroffer, which is prevalent in the private sector but for some reason doesn’t exist with Forest Service. So, I would love to see that legislation go forward, give you that authorization as another tool in the toolkit and another way for industry to be relevant in this space. I have also proposed using private sectors in whatever areas I can in all kinds of government service areas. There is a shortage of lumber and wood products during the pandemic, for instance, yet timber harvests have dropped since the early 1990s and wildfires have continued to skyrocket. The United States produced 112 million board feet in 1987, but in 2022 less than 5 million board feet. So, production has gone down while wildfires have gone up. You mentioned the problems23 with litigation. Are there other things that could be done to restore some balance here? No one is talking about clear cutting millions of acres, but having some kind of balance with American jobs and products so we don’t have to import so much from other countries. Mr. MOORE. Yes, Congressman, I have committed earlier with Chairman Tiffany to really take a look at our data because the information that you just shared, I have different information that says the opposite. And I think you can sometimes have a seesaw effect from year to year about what timber is, but my data is telling me that we have seen slight increases over the last 20 years, actually, to the tune of about 30 percent. So, I would like to be able to sit down, and I have agreed already to sit down with Committee members here to go into a bit more detail on sharing that information. Mr. LAMBORN. OK. Thank you. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. Mr. TIFFANY. The gentleman yields. I would now like to recognize the gentleman from California, Mr. McClintock, for his 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Welcome, Chief Moore. I am having nostalgic feelings for our meetings over the last 16 years, and I am very pleased to welcome you as the Chief of the Forest Service here today. A lot has happened in those 16 years, and it is heartbreaking. I am sure you have had the same experience. In my drives through the Sierra Nevada, whether it is to Yosemite or Lake Tahoe, Sequoia-Kings Canyon, or drives up to the Oregon border, beautiful forests that we used to take for granted are now simply gone. They have been reduced to scrub brush and dead tree trunks as far as the eye can see. I asked my staff to look into that because, is this an optical illu- sion, what do the statistics say? And their estimate is that about 25 percent of our national forests have burned down in the last 10 years. Does that comport with your general figures? Mr. MOORE. Yes, I don’t have the specific number, but I wouldn’t argue with that number, Congressman. A lot has burned. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. A quarter of our national forests gone, simply gone. Now, I am sure they will grow back in a century or two, but they are gone for all of us for the rest of our lifetimes, and for our children’s lifetimes. The Forest Service was supposed to protect our forests, and for generations they did. [Chart.] Mr. MCCLINTOCK. And getting to Mr. Lamborn’s point, I asked our staff to chart the board feet harvested out of the Federal forests and the acreage burned in our Federal forests. And this goes back from 1962 to 2022. You see the blue bars here? That is board feet harvested out of the national forests. The orange bars, that is acreage burned. And there is nothing subtle about this trend. It is dramatic. And you are right, it may vary from year to year, but you take a look at what has happened. As the Federal timber harvest has dropped precipitously, acreage burned has grown precipitously.24 Mr. MOORE. Yes. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. And we agree that about a quarter of those forests have now been destroyed by these policies. You and I both know that excess timber is going to come out of that forest in only one of two ways. Either we are going to carry it out or it is going to burn out. What do these charts tell you? Mr. MOORE. Well, they don’t tell me anything different than what they are telling you. I mean, I don’t think it is a big secret we are not managing to the degree that our forests need. We also don’t have—— Mr. MCCLINTOCK. And why aren’t we? Because this is one of the great ironies. You look at the private landowners. In California, about half of the forests are privately owned. They are kept in excellent condition, and the landowners make a lot of money doing that. The Federal forests are absolutely decrepit. Again, one quar- ter of them destroyed. Yet, we lose money. What is the difference? Mr. MOORE. The difference, and you may or may not care to hear this, but the difference is we don’t have the resources to manage the forests to the degree that they need to be managed. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Well, we used to, and we used to do it for a lot less. We used to make money harvesting this excess timber out of the forests. Now it costs us money. Mr. MOORE. Yes. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Not because of a lack of resources, but because the laws that have been adopted in the 1970s make it cost prohibi- tive for us to continue those sound forest management practices. So, not a lot gets done. And until you can acknowledge that, we are going to continue to have these discussions and these disagree- ments, and we are going to continue to watch our Federal forests die out and be burned out. I do want to compliment you on your administration of the WIIN Act of 2016 that got a categorical exclusion from NEPA for forest thinning projects under 10,000 acres. That was administered in the Tahoe Basin under your leadership, and I believe that that was exemplary. I have been trying to get legislation to the Floor that will extend those policies nationally. Would that help or hurt the cause of the forests? Mr. MOORE. Yes, Congresswoman McClintock, you and I go back quite a ways. And one of the benefits that we have gotten from some of your legislation was the 5,000-acre CE there on the Tahoe area. And that was very beneficial in actually creating and supporting an industry that was nearby. So, there are opportunities to—— Mr. MCCLINTOCK. I think it actually saved the city of South Lake Tahoe from the Caldor Fire. It hit a treated tract under that authority. The fire laid down, and firefighters were able to put it out. But I am having a hell of a time getting that onto the House Floor for a vote, despite the fact it came out of this Committee with a somewhat bipartisan vote. And with your experience with these policies, I would hope that we can get that into law, but we have to overcome a problem here in this House. But thank you for being here today. Thank you for your work all these years.25 Mr. TIFFANY. The gentleman yields. I now recognize the gentlelady from New Mexico for 5 minutes of questioning. Ms. STANSBURY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chief Moore, thank you so much for being here with us today. I am Melanie Stansbury. I represent New Mexico’s 1st Congressional District, which includes the Albuquerque area and 10 counties in central New Mexico. I want to start by, first of all, saying thank you. We had a fairly large wildfire break out in Lincoln County on the southern tip of my district just 2 weeks ago. And your incident command and all of the Forest Service guys who are out on the ground have done just an exemplary job, and I wanted to commend them and thank them for all of their work. In the early days of that fire, there were some communication challenges with some of the local residents, but your incident command got there, and they now have it almost completely contained, folks are back in their homes. So, I just want to say thank you. Oftentimes, the Forest Service doesn’t get their flowers for the good work that they do, so we really appreciate it. And I also want to say thank you to all the hotshot crews and firefighters who are out there on the ground. I am sure a lot of this has been covered this morning, but obvi- ously we are seeing a huge increase in both the number of fires and intensity of fires. And in New Mexico, this is certainly the case across the state. And the wildfire season is shifting dramatically earlier. I mean, we are already having fires across the state, and it is only May. And the questions I wanted to ask today are really about community collaborations with the Forest Service and resources that are available. And I want to kind of ask them in two tranches. One is about resources that are available to help communities that want to engage in forest thinning and treatments to help prevent fires, as well as some of the challenges we are seeing working with utilities, especially with climate change and how it is changing mitigation activities. So, if we could start talking about utilities, one of the challenges that we are seeing in New Mexico is that the current guidance, both from Forest Service and just the way in which utilities have managed their power lines, and I know this is true in California, as well, is that they had certain easements and cutbacks in terms of how close the forest was allowed to grow to the power lines. I believe it was 3 years ago we had the McBride Fire in Lincoln County, where we had 90-mile-an-hour winds, and we had a sap- ling that crossed with a power line, and basically ignited a massive fire. And the utilities were in the correct cutback zone, but with that kind of wind intensity it still happened. One of the things we are hearing, and I know this is a problem across the West, is that utilities just don’t have the resources. And Forest Service, of course, is also strapped in terms of manpower to get those mitigation easements cleaned up. So, talk to us about what resources are available. In my personal opinion, it is not acceptable to cut power to communities for days at a time. And absent resources, that is what our utilities are talking about doing. So, what is available? How do we deal with this problem?26 Mr. MOORE. First of all, thank you for that question, because we have been actively engaged with the utility industry over the course of the last couple of years because we know that that is a real critical area in the contributions to fire or mitigation from fire. Some of the things that we have done, and we started this in California, where we have streamlined our processes so that utility companies don’t have to come and get permission every time they do routine maintenance under their power lines. And we have been doing that across the country over the last couple of years, trying to see where and how we can streamline processes so that we are not a limiting factor for treating underneath those power lines. The other issue, which we don’t talk about too, though, is the whole issue around liability. And it is something that is there. We are going to have to have those tough conversations around it. And there are no solutions right now, but that is one of the biggest chal- lenges that I see, particularly for the small, rural cooperatives. They just don’t have the ability when fires strike. So, it is a critical area for us. We have to look at that because, just like you, I don’t see any scenario where we are not going to provide electricity to a lot of our rural users. Ms. STANSBURY. Yes. And at the end of the day, it is not just a climate mitigation issue and a public safety issue. I mean, this is people’s lives on the line. We are talking about in Lincoln County, for example, if they cut power to a community like Ruidoso, we are talking hospitals, clinics. I mean, this is going to actually impact real lives and the local economy in this rural area. The other piece I get asked all the time is that we have 23 Tribal Nations in New Mexico. They absolutely would like to partner with the Forest Service to do forest treatments, but are struggling to identify where the money is, how to engage in those conversations. What part of the Forest Service is the best point of contact to understand how to access these infrastructure and IRA monies and those co-stewardship agreements? Mr. MOORE. Well, typically, depending on the location, they should be contacting the forest supervisor. And if that forest super- visor is not available, I mean, the regional forester. But my office, if you just can’t get any help, for someone like you, if you contact me or my office, that is another way to get that pushed down. But normally, if everything was working as it should be, then our tribes should be working with the forest supervisor. Ms. STANSBURY. Excellent. Maybe a follow-up on this, and we would love to engage with you all on this, is to ask your forest supervisors at large to do more proactive engagement with our tribes and consultation on funding resources available. Mr. MOORE. Yes, Congresswoman, I don’t know if you aware, but we have developed a whole Tribal Action Plan, and a part of that plan is to educate the entire workforce on tribal issues. So, we have moved to make great strides in that area. In fact, we have changed our State and Private Forestry name to State, Private and Tribal. And we are making tremendous strides in trying to improve the relationships with a lot of our tribal communities. Ms. STANSBURY. Excellent. Well, I think at the end of the day, it really comes down——27 Mr. TIFFANY. The gentlelady’s time has expired. Ms. STANSBURY. Oh, I am just going to wrap up my sentence. We would love to engage with you on that issue. It is really important to our Tribal Nations. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate it. Mr. TIFFANY. You are welcome for the extra time. I would like to recognize the gentleman from Oregon for 5 minutes. Mr. BENTZ. Thank you, Mr. Chair. And thank you, Chief, for being here today. I also want to thank you for the prompt response to my concern raised at our last meeting regarding the tribal stewardship contracts out in Oregon. And there was a prompt reaching out, and we very much appreciate that. Also, I want to give a shout out to Merv George for his work. It has been excellent, and we are very appreciative of his work and yours in putting together the memorandum of understanding on allowing private parties to suppress fires on Federal land in Oregon. That is hugely important, given the checkerboard nature of which you are all too familiar with of that land. So, perhaps a comment of why you supported the MOU that allows private parties to go on Federal land and put out fires. Mr. MOORE. One of the things that we want to do is bring the community into the decision space on some of the things that are taking place. No one cares about the community better than the people that live in those communities, so bringing them to the table and not just to get their opinion, but also giving them decision space, it is the right thing to do, and it is the necessary thing to do. And what we are finding, by bringing the community into discus- sion, is that we are getting better-supported solutions. And that is one of the solutions. You may or may not be familiar with what just happened yesterday in the Bend area, having a tentative agreement on the homeless issue there. And I would say that just having a lot of different entities engaged in solutions and discov- ering solutions has really been a win-win for everyone. Mr. BENTZ. Well, we hope for that outcome in and around Bend, for sure. It has been a long time coming. But yay. Let’s talk about the amount that people are being paid right now to fight fires. And one of the situations that has occurred is that the people actually that are contracting have had pay increases im- posed upon them for $10 an hour, I think, for those that are out fighting fire. But that $10 did not extend to the folks who had been there longer. And as a result, what we have are people at the lower end of the pay scale getting a $10-an-hour increase, but people at the higher level, no. And that is creating incredible difficulties. My understanding is that you folks have been working on this, but there has been no resolution. Can you bring us up to date on how this is—— Mr. MOORE. Are you talking about the pay bump that the firefighters got? Mr. BENTZ. Yes. Mr. MOORE. There was actually a $20,000 pay bump for GS-10s and below. And a part of that was to get at the issue around28 retention that we were having across the agency. And the other thing is that we had to do this because you could work at a fast food restaurant and make more than a number of our firefighters were making—— Mr. BENTZ. Right, I don’t think I am talking about Federal employees. I think I am talking about contract employees that are working for people who are contracting to do firefighting. Mr. MOORE. Yes, I am not familiar with that. I know we are required on the Davis-Bacon Act to pay appropriate wages. I would be happy to follow up with you to get more specifics on that par- ticular issue. Mr. BENTZ. Please, if you would, we would very much appreciate that. Mr. MOORE. OK. Mr. BENTZ. Also, there has been an issue raised that has to do with the nature of Forest Service contracting when it comes to going for the cheapest possible bid as opposed to the more quality, experienced, long-term contracts. And this is a decision made inside the Forest Service. And the result has been perhaps less money paid out, but perhaps not the quality of the project being done that all of us want. Can you talk about that for a moment? Mr. MOORE. Yes. You may be talking about getting the cheapest bid, or the best value bid would be another way. And we have been looking at exploring the best value-type contracts, because it gives a local contractor an opportunity to win a number of those contracts. Here again, if I had specifics on specific contracts, I can give you a specific response or answer. And I would be happy to follow up with you. Mr. BENTZ. No, thank you for that, and we will get you those specific instances of where long-term folks who have been doing the job quite well suddenly are being outbid by people that come in from goodness knows where, and the job that gets done is not what you, I think, or I would want from a quality standpoint. My last question has to do with the success of the categorical exclusion as a device to get us into the woods. What is your com- ment? What is your thought? Should we be, as the Congressman from California suggested, expanding upon the CEs? Mr. MOORE. Yes, as a matter of fact, I have looked at the NEPA that we use across the country, and about 87 percent of our NEPA is done through CEs, and that is about 1,134 CEs that we have used, as opposed to about 150 EAs and about 7 EISs. Mr. BENTZ. Thank you so much. I yield back. Mr. TIFFANY. The gentleman yields. I would now like to recognize the gentlelady from New Mexico, Ms. Leger Fernández. Ms. LEGER FERNÁNDEZ. Thank you. Mr. TIFFANY. For 5 minutes. Ms. LEGER FERNÁNDEZ. Thank you very much, and thank you, Chief Moore. We talk often. And I really want to thank you for advocating for comprehensive pay, the $20,000 bump you just talked about for housing, because we need to make sure that our forest fighters and the people who not just fight the forests, but who care for the forests have housing,29 addressing mental health, and the well-being of our Federal fire- fighters. Those of us who live among the forests and play among the forests know the hard work that they do and the sacrifices that they endure on behalf of the communities and those firefighters, and they are often from those communities, and I think that that is really key. I also want to thank the heroic men and women who are pres- ently fighting the Indios wildfire in my district. As you know, we have several wildfires going in New Mexico. And I was struck by the fact that in 2022, Congress appropriated $10.8 billion to the Forest Service. Is that correct? Mr. MOORE. Through the BIL and IRA, you mean? Ms. LEGER FERNÁNDEZ. Yes. Mr. MOORE. Yes, that is right. Ms. LEGER FERNÁNDEZ. And then, according to your written tes- timony, that same year the Forest Service contributed $44.3 billion to our country’s GDP. So, we invested $10.8 billion in the Forest Service, we got 400 percent back as a return on investment. And I think that that is really important for us to think about when we are thinking about these budgets, is that we are investing, that they are investments. They are not something that goes away, they are not frivolous. It is not waste. They are investments, and they are giving us a tremendous return. Now, when you are thinking about investments, though, because of Republican cuts you are operating on an $8.2 billion budget, and that is a 25 percent cut from 2022. Correct? Mr. MOORE. Right. Ms. LEGER FERNÁNDEZ. So, I think we go back to that we have to invest in those places that protect us and those places that gen- erate the kind of revenue we are talking about. But I want to go to something that maybe might be seen by some as small, but by the communities that are impacted, it is very large, and that is cemeteries. It is my understanding that if a cem- etery is on Forest Service land and a community would like to have that cemetery returned to them, the Forest Service must go through an expensive process of evaluation: is there a reason for transferring it, is there authority, what is the dollar value? And there is a long, bureaucratic process for transferring back to a com- munity a place where they have buried their ancestors, where you know you are not going to do anything else with that cemetery because it is hallowed ground. Is that right? Mr. MOORE. Yes, that is something that we should really talk more about because you are right, we are not going to do any kind of management activities on those lands. And as you know, too, we are required to follow laws and procedures, but I think we would be willing to sit down and see what would be a wonderful solution to this issue that you are bringing up. Ms. LEGER FERNÁNDEZ. Right. I think an amendment to the Small Tracts Act, so we will look forward to working with you on that because I think anybody around this rotunda would recognize that that is something that we are going to need to transfer back to those people whose ancestors are there. The other thing, Chief Moore, I think the first time you and I spoke was after the first fire that the Forest Service started in New30 Mexico that got out of control, and I know you did a review, but we also asked for a Government Accountability Office review, a GAO review. That is now coming to completion. And while I welcome what you have done in yours, I think it was essential that we have that independent look that looked at all fires because we started with that one, and then we had a second one where you walked away from the campfire, as I call it. Nobody should walk away from the campfire. So, you haven’t seen the report yet, but I think I am going to be asking you for a commit- ment to implement what the GAO has identified. Can you give me that commitment? Mr. MOORE. Yes. In fact, I would be really interested in seeing what the GAO report has. As you may recall, right after that Hermits Peak Calf Canyon Fire, I called a 90-day pause on all prescribed burns across the agency. And in that process, we looked at all of our prescribed burning, and we made some recommendations that we are living by today in that. Ms. LEGER FERNÁNDEZ. Well, we are not living by all of the rec- ommendations, or not living by everything that you have com- mitted to me. I mean, we need to really make sure that the drones and the infrared technology is being deployed for prescribed burns. There are some things that we need to get done. And in your initial report following Hermits Peak, there were a lot of issues, and ‘‘Oh, but we did everything right,’’ and it is like you had a whole list of issues that were done wrong. So, I think we need to be careful, be- cause sometimes you have wanted to have it both ways. We are going to be doing this, but also then not truly, truly owning the mistakes that were made. So, hopefully, the GAO report will give us new insight, and hope- fully you will be willing to make sure they get implemented. Mr. MOORE. Yes, and I can give you an example of it. I know you are real big on the use of drones to monitor fires. And we have committed to using drones where necessary and when necessary. One of the challenges that we really have from drones is that we have a requirement that we cannot use drones with Chinese prod- ucts in them. And a drone without that, in many cases, it costs us $80,000 for each one, as opposed to a much cheaper drone using other types. So, we have to work that out from a budget stand- point, as well. But we are working on that. We are committed to it, and we know that the technology is rapidly changing every day. And while we may not have that opportunity now, we think that in the future, because of the development of the technology, we would be able to use that going into the future. Ms. LEGER FERNÁNDEZ. Right. Well, the Biden administration has been real big on making sure that we bring manufacturing back home. But we have gone over our time. These New Mexican women, we just want to have long conversations, Mr. Chair. Mr. TIFFANY. No comment. [Laughter.] Ms. LEGER FERNÁNDEZ. I yield back.31 Mr. TIFFANY. I would just gently chide my colleague from New Mexico in regards to the Republicans reducing funding in the latest appropriations bill for the U.S. Forest Service. Take a look at the number of people on the other side of the aisle that voted for that bill that reduces funding. I recognize the gentleman from California, Mr. LaMalfa, for 5 minutes. Mr. LAMALFA. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the opportunity. Thank you, Chief Moore, for appearing today. We go back a long way, don’t we? Mr. MOORE. We do. Mr. LAMALFA. To the West. So, let’s talk about the harvest num- bers for a moment here. I would like to understand better how you are arriving at a 30 percent increase over, how many years was it, 20? Mr. MOORE. Yes, the last 20 years. Mr. LAMALFA. Because with the chart I have, the information and the trend seems to be over a much longer period of time, where harvest being these olive-colored ones here, going from this is still the late 1980s right here, 12 billion board feet down to the low of about 2002. So, if you start at 2002 and trend up from there, you could see a slight increase, but a fairly flat one in board feet, but a dramatic drop-off from here. And then doggone it, it coincides with acres burned, vastly increasing at that point, too, as we have suffered so much in the West especially on that. So, I would like to understand how you are arriving at board feet harvested, is that the terminology you would like to use on that? Mr. MOORE. Sold, board feet sold. Mr. LAMALFA. Sold, sold. So, does that mean it is delivered? Mr. MOORE. That means it is sold. I will give you an example. And we can break it down by each area. Mr. LAMALFA. Well, time is short, and I am not going to get New Mexico time, probably. But board feet sold versus actually deliv- ered. I want to know how many feet are coming out of the forests in marketable timber, lumber. Mr. MOORE. Well, that was it. I mean, our target this year is 3.2 billion board feet. Mr. LAMALFA. Which is a lower number than last year, yet there is projected to be a lower number for following years. But we had these huge numbers years ago. Mr. MOORE. Well, it is more than what we actually achieved last year. Mr. LAMALFA. Achieved, yes, but you fell short of the goal by about a quarter billion board feet of last year’s goal. Mr. MOORE. Yes, there is a lot that is not being brought up in this conversation, so I—— Mr. LAMALFA. And it is tough, 5 minutes at a time here. But when you talked about litigation a bit earlier stopping you from hitting that goal by a quarter billion feet. Just an idea, I am not trying to be mean here, but why wouldn’t you open more bids so that you have more being litigated at the same time, and more of them actually fall through the hole and make it, and then reach the number?32 Mr. MOORE. Well, that would be an approach, Congressman, but that is not the one that we are choosing to do, simply because we don’t have—— Mr. LAMALFA. Why don’t you choose to do more? Because we are suffering out here. Mr. MOORE. We don’t have the ability to do more than what we are currently doing—— Mr. LAMALFA. You just had a massive influx of money here from the IRA recently. They told us at a hearing in Spearfish, South Dakota, they said, ‘‘We have more money right now than we have ever had.’’ Yet, they still wanted $20 million more to do a project there that the Nyman Company needed. They have just laid off 50 workers there at their plant in Spearfish because they can’t keep up. They can’t get out in the forest enough to do, they need about 120 million board feet to do the job. And as of March, they only had 10 million over the whole year. So, they have since subse- quently laid off 50 people there. We have lost 50 mills in the last 18 months or 15 months or so. I don’t know where the infrastruc- ture is going to be to process what it is the output is. Let me ask a number from you here. If we are putting out 3.1 to 3.4 billion, how many board feet are being grown in your forest in a year? How much are the trees just out there growing per year? Mr. MOORE. There were about three or four questions there, so—— Mr. LAMALFA. Well, just the one. How many board feet are you growing on your 193 million acres, do you think, annually? Mr. MOORE. Well, how I am going to answer you is that there are different ways to look at that. And I know some of your friends in the industry are giving you a number. They are looking at—— Mr. LAMALFA. I don’t have a number off the top of my head. No one has given me a number. I am asking you, sir. Mr. MOORE. Well, we are cutting below the ASQ, if I looked at all the plans across the country. And we are cutting that below ASQ because we don’t have the resources to cut more than what we are currently cutting. Mr. LAMALFA. Do you think we are growing about 6 billion board feet per year out in our forests, maybe? Mr. MOORE. I can’t give you that with any confidence. Mr. LAMALFA. It has to be in that ballpark, 5 to 6 billion. But we are cutting 3, 31⁄2 as a goal. So, over a period of time, how are we going to ever keep up with the amount of board feet that are growing and the density we are talking about? Ms. Stansbury was talking about the power lines a little bit, and I hope people can support the farm bill because I have a piece in there to expand the gap between power lines and the forests from 10 feet to 50 feet, and we had to pass a law in 2018 to direct your agency to be more timely in getting permits out to take hazardous trees. And we are trying to build upon that because 10 feet is not a lot when the power line is shorter than the trees next to it. I would like it even wider than 50, if you want to take it, because, as Ms. Stansbury said, we are shutting down people’s power. Like in Tehama County, sometimes I drive through there in the past, and the whole county is shut off at night in Northern California33 because the wind might blow in this first-world country and cause a power line problem. So, we need a lot better output on board feet taken because it is not keeping up. And I would certainly like to hear more about your numbers on how you come up with that trend over the 20, 30 years versus an actual decrease in what you are expecting to do the next 2 years with 200 million board feet. Let me close on the idea that you are trying to free up $1.36 billion to take it into emergency spending, which means a lot more discretionary. Do you intend to purchase electric vehicles with this freed-up money that is going to be in your main budget now? Mr. MOORE. I don’t know, but I wouldn’t be surprised if we do purchase some electric vehicles. Mr. LAMALFA. Will that be in the forest, or will they be running around in DC with those? Mr. MOORE. Congressman, I understand your position on this. Mr. LAMALFA. No, I am just asking the question, though. Are you going to buy a bunch of electric vehicles? Mr. MOORE. Well, the other thing that we are trying to do to complement that is also look at electric plug-in spots on some of our campgrounds so that the people that do have electric vehicles can plug in while they are out visiting the recreation. Mr. LAMALFA. But we don’t have enough money to help the Spearfish, South Dakota to be able to get their timber harvest done. I had better yield back, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. Mr. TIFFANY. We are off New Mexico time now. I would like to recognize the gentleman from Utah. Mr. CURTIS. Thank you. Mr. TIFFANY. And before you start, Mr. Curtis, the Chief has agreed that we are going to evaluate these numbers that are being put out. We are seeing some discrepancies. And we are going to work together with the Chairman of the Full Committee and others to match our numbers up, and see exactly where we stand. And I really appreciate the Chief and his willingness to be able to do that. Mr. Curtis. Mr. CURTIS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chief, thank you for being with us. I don’t know how familiar you are with Utah. Have you ever been to Utah? Mr. MOORE. Lots of times. Mr. CURTIS. Two-thirds of the land in Utah is owned by the Federal Government. I have parts of my district that are 90 percent. So, you can see right off, if we are not getting the help and the coordination that we need from the Federal Government we are literally shut down as a state. And I would like to bring up some specifics with you today. As part of this experience in Utah and these amazing recreational areas, we are very dependent on local guides who can provide education, who can provide safety as people go into these areas. You can see sometimes if people go into these areas by themselves, it is hugely problematic. Yet, our local guides are expe- riencing great frustration, as am I, in their ability to get permits to do that. And my office has been working with the leadership of34 the Salt Lake Ranger District to address primarily two issues: first, the refusal to turn temporary permits into long-term priority use permits; and more recently, the termination of access to the Lone Peak Wilderness Area, where guides have been going for decades, and was recently reaffirmed in the 2022 permits, as is consistent with the management plan. Yet, frankly, I am frustrated, they are frustrated, and I have sent you a detailed letter which I would like to enter into the record that explains the situation. Mr. TIFFANY. Without objection, so ordered. [The information follows:] Congress of the United States Washington, DC June 3, 2024 Thomas J. Vilsack, Secretary US Department of Agriculture 1400 Independence Ave SW Washington, DC 20250 Re: Outfitter and Guide Permits on the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest Dear Secretary Vilsack: We write today with serious concerns regarding the management of outfitter and guide permits on the Salt Lake Ranger District (SLRD) of the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest (UWCNF). For many years, there have been unnecessary limita- tions imposed on outfitters and guides seeking to operate in this Ranger District. Before Members of Congress became involved several years ago, the guides them- selves made lengthy and sincere efforts to address these issues with the Supervisor of this forest, David Whittekiend. I enclose attached documentation of those efforts with this correspondence. We write you today because the SLRD has continued to limit access to the Forest. Most recently, the SLRD instituted an unnecessary mora- torium on temporary permit holders in the Lone Peak Wilderness, which will also apply to priority permit holders at permit renewal. Furthermore, the SLRD has declined to take steps to issue long-term permits that would resolve many of these issues. While Members of Congress and guides have tried to work with the SLRD, we regret that none of the solutions suggested have met with Mr. Whittekiend’s approval. On the one occasion the Supervisor did agree to Congressman Curtis’s request to rescind the termination of all temporary guide and outfitter permits last year, he subsequently revoked the guides’ and outfitters’ access to the Lone Peak Wilderness area where guides have worked for decades. The explanation provided by the Supervisor contradicted his own decision to allow guiding in this area just two years prior. The fact that the Supervisor revoked and then reinstated access to this area in 2022, and is now doing so again, causes confusion among the public and the guides, interferes with public access to education and safety leadership, and disrupts the activities of hard-working local business owners and their employees. The guides and outfitters who serve the public through your permit system are instrumental in providing access to forest lands for people who are not able to visit on their own, whether due to a lack of experience, skills, or equipment. It is impor- tant to remember these people are part of the public we serve, and the public deserves an opportunity to experience their public lands with the assistance of a guide. The guides also promote safety education and Leave No Trace practices which directly support the goals of the US Forest Service. Uneducated visitors in a dangerous backcountry environment are a threat to themselves and others, poten- tially straining search and rescue resources. The two primary concerns that have arisen in the last year involve: (1) the revoca- tion of access to the Lone Peak Wilderness area, which has been available to guides for decades prior, and (2) the ongoing lack of long-term priority use permits. The reasons given for both actions appear vacuous and contradictory.35 The basis provided for the inability to issue long-term permits (at an in-person meeting with the forest service supervisor, his staff, Congressman Curtis and his staff, and several guides and outfitters on November 21, 2023) was lack of per- sonnel. Implementing more long-term permits would considerably alleviate the workload for agency staff (and guides) by reducing the frequency of permit renewals from every six months to every 10 years. The group pointed out that the Forest Service Enterprise Program was created to assist local staff with projects such as the development of long-term permit opportunities (see https://www.fs.usda.gov/ enterprise/skills-and-services.php). The group questioned why permanent priority permits were not forthcoming to save the extra work associated with the reissuance of temporary permits each year and pointed to the Enterprise Program as a poten- tial resource to develop long-term permits. Nothing was accepted as a satisfactory resolution. Only after Congressman Curtis described the Supervisor’s position as un- acceptable did Mr. Whittekiend indicate he would consider alternatives, including assuring Congressman Curtis he would work toward the development of more long- term priority permit opportunities for the temporary permittees. Also of great concern, when winter season temporary permits were issued in January of this year, approximately 8 weeks after the November 21 meeting, the permits unexpectedly excluded the Lone Peak Wilderness. This came as a great shock to the guides, to us, and the to the public. Outfitting and guiding activities have occurred in this wilderness area for decades, and for good reason—there are highly desirable climbing, skiing, hiking, and camping opportunities that the public wishes to experience with the expertise of a guide. The guides’ and outfitters’ dis- may at this development is unsurprising, as this issue was reviewed and addressed in 2022 when access had previously been revoked, then reinstated. The 2022 Letter To File (attached), interpreting the 2003 Wasatch-Cache Land and Resource Management Plan, states: Given our reliance on outfitting and guiding companies to provide the valuable educational services to the public, the increased use of climbing areas in wilderness, and the increased visitation of recreational visitors in the Salt Lake Ranger District, it appears to be contradictory to limit out- fitter and guiding companies if the desired future condition is to have a well-educated public that uses National Forest system lands. (emphasis added). This language shows that in 2022 the Supervisor recognized that outfitters and guides are important for educating the public, particularly as more people visit the forest. Nothing has changed since 2022 to warrant this change in position. Congressman Curtis wrote a letter to Mr. Whittekiend requesting that he follow his prior 2022 interpretation and remove the prohibition on outfitting and guiding in the SLRD Lone Peak Wilderness (see letter of March 28, 2024), attached). Mr. Whittekiend refused, and specifically blamed Congressman Curtis’s prior request as part of the basis for this new decision. ‘‘This approach was necessary to expedite the request by your office and local outfitter and guides to issue winter temporary outfitter and guiding permits.’’ Learning to innovate and be creative in solving challenges is something we do well in Utah and which this local office seems to resist. We, the Utah delegation, would appreciate any assistance your office can provide in reinstating outfitting and guiding access to the Lone Peak Wilderness and taking steps toward the develop- ment of long-term outfitting and guiding permits on the Salt Lake Ranger District. Thank you for your attention to these very important issues. Sincerely, John R. Curtis Blake D. Moore Member of Congress Member of Congress Burgess Owens Celeste Maloy Member of Congress Member of Congress Michael S. Lee Mitt Romney United States Senate United States Senate36 Mr. CURTIS. Thank you. The Utah Wasatch-Cache National Forest has been unwilling to work with us on finding creative ways to meet the needs for more priority permit holders, as opposed to temporary permit holders. Every time we meet with the Super- visor, there is a half-hearted attempt to address the limitations im- posed on guides. However, a few weeks later those promises are unfulfilled and we are actually further away than when we started. That feels very punitive, and you can imagine how my constituents feel about that who are dependent on a living and provide a service to these people. For example, after reluctantly agreeing not to terminate all tem- porary guide and outfitter permits last year, only after a personal plea from me and meeting with them, the Supervisor subsequently revoked their access to the Lone Peak Wilderness Area, even though he told me he wouldn’t. This has led to this amazing frus- tration, and I regret that we couldn’t resolve this with this local office and I have to bring it here in a public manner to you, but I don’t know what else to do. So, my question is, will you take immediate steps to provide more long-term outfitting and guiding permits in the Salt Lake Ranger District? Mr. MOORE. Yes, Vice Chairman, I just recently became aware of this very issue that you are bringing up here and the letter that you sent to the Secretary. But the short answer is yes, of course. I want to work with you on a solution to this. Mr. CURTIS. OK. If it is, and listen, I get it, a lack of resources, I can’t imagine what the people out in the field are asked to deal with, with the lack of resources. Can we get the resources needed into this district so these permits can be issued? Mr. MOORE. Will you allow me to take a look at this issue, get with the region and the forest so that I have a better under- standing of what is really going on? But I will commit to you that I will work for a solution. Mr. CURTIS. Thank you. I will take you up on that, and would love to work with you personally. You can see how important this is, right? We have these access areas. If we don’t have the guides, people go in by themselves. We end up costing more resources than otherwise. And this is a livelihood for many people in our state. That is very, very important. And when they get an answer and then it changes, you can see the frustration that we have. Mr. MOORE. Sure. Mr. CURTIS. Thank you. I would like to bring up another issue. Not far from there is the Black Hawk Campground. In 2018, there was a serious fire up in Payson Canyon. It destroyed the campground, unfortunately. It was a very popular campground. It took a lot of pressure off other areas because of this campground. Also because of a lack of resources this campground has not been reopened since 2018. Likewise, I will just tell you, as I met with local officials in the area last week they told me there is a sense that the Forest Service is actually intentionally gradually shutting down more and more access. And by not reopening this campground, it plays into that narrative. The people on the ground are willing to volunteer. They37 are willing to bring local resources to get this campground back open. Likewise, will you work with me to figure out how we can get this campground back open? Mr. MOORE. Yes, I will work with you on that. Mr. CURTIS. Thank you. I can’t ask for anything more than that, and I appreciate your attention to these very important issues. Mr. MOORE. Thank you. Mr. CURTIS. Thank you. I yield my time. Mr. TIFFANY. The gentleman yields, and I will turn to the Chair- man of the Full Committee, Mr. Westerman, for his questioning. Mr. WESTERMAN. Thank you, Chairman Tiffany. Thank you again, Chief Moore, for being here today. I think you and I agree on a lot of things in your testimony. In your written testimony, you use the word ‘‘access’’ 10 times, and I have said that we need to practice conservation through access. I was intrigued by the very similar graphs that Mr. McClintock and Mr. LaMalfa put up that showed the harvest levels and the amount of forest fires, and how there was an inflection point. And I think we both agree that we want to see more management done on the forests to keep them healthy. So, if we go back to where that inflection point was, it was in the 1980s and really in the 1990s where we quit harvesting, and the amount of forest fires started increasing. But if you look at the specific policies that happened then, in the West you had the spotted owl controversy. And the idea was we are going to stop har- vesting and we are going to save the spotted owl. Can you tell me what is happening to spotted owl populations in the West since that policy went in place? Mr. MOORE. Well, I think, according to my knowledge, they have continued to decline. Mr. WESTERMAN. At about 4 percent per year is what I have read. So, the policy hasn’t worked to save the spotted owl, and we can, in hindsight, decades and decades later, look back and say this was a weaponized rule just to stop management on the forests, which was really a bad idea for the species and for the forests, as well. There was also another rule, and I emphasize the word ‘‘rule,’’ not a law, put in place by Congress called the Roadless Rule. And I was visiting with folks from Finland the other day, and they were talking about how much pride they take in building roads and having access into their forests so they can manage better. And they were just befuddled by the idea that we build roads and then tear them out, which is a huge cost. And it is also a way to deny access when we put roads in and take them out. How critical are roads to doing not only management, but creating firebreaks and being able to get crews in to do fire sup- pression when needed? How critical are roads to that? Mr. MOORE. Well, I mean, yes, they are necessary, critical. Mr. WESTERMAN. Yes. And if we don’t have roads, we end up spending a lot of money with tankers dropping fire retardants. And it just seems like we made some really bad decisions three or four decades ago that are really costing us on the backside right now.38 I have a lot of U.S. Forest Service land in my district, and I have always defended the Forest Service because I think the manage- ment on the Ouachita and the Ozark is as good as anywhere in the country, although there is room for improvement. In Montgomery County in my district, about 85 percent of the forests are Forest Service lands. I held a mobile office there a few weeks ago. Twenty-five people came in, and their issue was access on the Forest Service land. Some of them had been given tickets for riding down roads that were closed that they didn’t know were closed, and then roads being closed off. So, in what world does it make sense that we don’t create more access into these forests, and that we don’t leave the roads in place after we go in and do management? I have seen it firsthand, a lot of money spent building a road, you go in and do the management, and then a lot of money spent tearing the road out and trying to return it back. Does that really make sense to do that? Mr. MOORE. Well, I think some of the logic around that, whether we can agree on that or not, and I don’t know the specific reason, but sometimes we build spec roads so that the timber industry that won the bid can go in and remove the timber, and when they are done with it, then we put the road to bed, we close it. I don’t know if that is the situation there that you are referring to, but that has been somewhat of a common practice. Mr. WESTERMAN. Yes, these are roads that have been open for a long time. And it is the No. 1 complaint I hear on the forests in my district are people have access denied to go on these roads. There is a crazy rule where you can drive a log truck or a pas- senger vehicle, but you can’t drive an ATV down these roads, and that just doesn’t make sense to the general public when things like that happen. So, I would hope that we would take another look at roads and access on the forests, and use some common sense there. It seems to me like it would be a huge benefit to the Forest Service, as far as public relations go, when you don’t have Members of Congress’ constituents calling them all the time, saying, ‘‘Why is the Forest Service doing this crazy rule? Is it their job to keep taxpaying Americans off of the public land?’’ Because that is how they see it. With that, I will yield back. Mr. TIFFANY. The gentleman yields, and I am going to take a few minutes here for questioning. And I want to piggyback on what the Chairman was just asking there. We just had that field hearing, as you know, Chief Moore, up in Hayward, Wisconsin in regards to access, and heard some very good stories. Currently, the Forest Service is decommissioning an average of 2,000 miles of road annually. Is that accurate? Mr. MOORE. I don’t have that information available, but I wouldn’t be surprised by it, sir. Mr. TIFFANY. Yes, I think that number is, I mean, think about that. That is 2,000 miles annually that are being reduced for access. And to the Chairman’s point, sometimes that road that is built to high specifications, when it is removed, it is removed at the cost to the contractor. So, the contractor is having to reduce their bid39 as a result of having to pay for the cost of removing the road. So, the Federal Treasury actually ends up with less money as a result of that. And it goes back to what the Chairman was saying, is that it just doesn’t make sense to the public, and especially many of them don’t know what I just shared with you in regards to the road removal. But when they hear it, they just go, duh, why are we doing these things? So, I guess my question is, this is a growing problem in regards to access. Will you commit to working with us to bring more access to the public? Mr. MOORE. Mr. Chairman, yes, I want to be able to work with you and all of our public on access. I also want you to be able to understand the challenges that we have, too, because sometimes we can bring up individual pieces from a common-sense standpoint, why are we doing this? Let me just share with you, though, as I look across the agency and what we are being asked to do. We are being asked to manage a road system of about 371,000 miles. And in that 371,000 miles of roads, we are only funded at about 25 percent to do that. I don’t want to close roads, and yet I am not funded to maintain the road system that we currently have. So, it is a real dilemma for us in the Forest Service to be able to do that. So, I am not surprised. I am disappointed that we have some common-sense kinds of things that we can’t come to an agreement, and I want to work on those types of things. Mr. TIFFANY. I would just share with you that I think there are people locally that are willing to help in regards to this. I think there needs to be greater engagement in that regard, because that is what we heard at the hearing, is that there are people, including private individuals, that are willing to help out in this process to be able to make this happen. The other thing is that some would say that the Forest Service is far too passive in pushing back against those who want to put the restrictions in place. In fact, in the Forest Service, you have a broad range of ideologies, but there are some in the Forest Service that actually want to see greater restrictions. And that is where your leadership is valued so much is to be able to cut through that, where somebody’s personal beliefs enter into public decision- making. Mr. MOORE. Yes, but Mr. Chairman, let’s take a look at that. Mr. TIFFANY. Do you want us to report the employees that aren’t—— Mr. MOORE. No, I want to be able to go out on that road that you are talking about, and let’s see what is possible talking with some of the public there. Mr. TIFFANY. OK. We will invite you up to meet my good friend, Senator Rob Stafsholt, and he will give you a tour, just as we had. Mr. MOORE. Great. Mr. TIFFANY. So, yes, let’s see if we can do that. And by the way, I want to thank—your staff in Wisconsin was there, Director Youngblood, and we really appreciate that she attended that access hearing.40 So, the 2025 budget requests $124 million for new land acquisi- tions. Is that a good idea with a backlog of maintenance? Mr. MOORE. Well, here again, let’s look at the specifics of what has been requested, because sometimes land acquisition is for better access to the public lands. Sometimes it is for more efficient management. So, without knowing these specifics of a particular area, I would say there are different reasons for it. Mr. TIFFANY. Yes, I think with the maintenance backlog that is going on, I mean, it should be a very high bar that we will be adding to the Federal estate at this point when we hear that there is this whole maintenance backlog. How much more money do you need? Mr. MOORE. Well, if you doubled our budget right now, Mr. Chairman, we would certainly make that work, but it wouldn’t be enough to do everything that is being asked. That is how under- funded—and I just gave you an example, it was a 371,000-mile road system, and we are only funded at 25 percent of it. Mr. TIFFANY. So, doubling the road budget would accomplish—— Mr. MOORE. Well, another example, because I can give you a specific number, but in general, when I look at the deferred main- tenance backlog of over $8 billion, $5.45 billion of that is for roads, bridges, and dams. So, there is a lot of work to be done out there, and we are just not funded even to maintain the system that we have. Mr. TIFFANY. Looking at those charts, two of them that you saw earlier over to my right, isn’t that one of the ways that we could get there, is to harvest more wood? Mr. MOORE. Well, yes, there is no silver bullet, so to speak. But yes, I mean, there are a lot of different ways to help us get there. Mr. TIFFANY. In your testimony, you referred to green jobs, amongst other things that are benefits. What is a green job? Mr. MOORE. Well, I don’t know that I use that very much, but a green job is one of those jobs that I think is going to be working with the environment to keep it healthy and resilient. Mr. TIFFANY. It was a recommendation that you put ‘‘green job’’ in your testimony, I take it. You don’t have to answer that question. That is fine. What is old growth? Mr. MOORE. Well, it depends on the species in terms of how you define that. But I think, in general, it is large, older trees. Mr. TIFFANY. Is it defined? Mr. MOORE. Yes, it is defined by species, but basically, just for simple language, it is the older trees that we have in the forests. Mr. TIFFANY. So, in an executive summary here that comes from both the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management, it says the terms ‘‘old growth forest’’ and ‘‘mature forest’’ have not been consistently defined. Would you agree with that characterization? Mr. MOORE. Yes, I would. Mr. TIFFANY. Because just this past week, some constituents up in my district posed that question to staff, and they did not have an answer, similar to what you are saying here. It is not defined, correct?41 Mr. MOORE. I say it is defined by different species. Different species have different age classes of what is considered old growth. Mr. TIFFANY. But it is not defined, as it says in—— Mr. MOORE. Yes, just trying to keep it simple, there is no agreed- upon, I think, generally agreed-upon definition, other than if you look at it by species, which varies. Mr. TIFFANY. I think the Biden administration came out with a Land Management Plan Direction for Old Growth Forest Conditions across the National Forest System. Are you familiar with that? Mr. MOORE. I am. Mr. TIFFANY. And the Forest Service is considering amending 128 Land Management Plans, is that right? Mr. MOORE. That is correct, yes. Mr. TIFFANY. And doing it through a single EIS? Mr. MOORE. You mean for old growth? Mr. TIFFANY. Yes. Mr. MOORE. Yes. Mr. TIFFANY. Is that consistent with the law, to amend those 128 Land Management Plans, individual Land Management Plans, with one EIS? Mr. MOORE. Yes. I mean, obviously, we can do that. But you have to amend all 128 plans. Right now, one of the bigger challenges we have with old growth is there is no consistent way of how we manage old growth. So, this Forest Plan amendment is to come up with a framework for how we manage old growth, but also leave flexibility at the local level to make some decisions in how it is managed. Mr. TIFFANY. Are you familiar with the 2012 Planning Rule? Mr. MOORE. I used to be. Somewhat still. Mr. TIFFANY. Yes. I mean, it rings a bell, right? I am not asking you for specifics here, trying to trap you, anything like that. It says here among the 2012 rule’s purposes was to provide for a transparent, coordinated process. Whereas, with what is being proposed with this old growth Land Management Plan, it says the Forest Service’s willingness is to now convert its commitment to a transparent, collaborative process. Isn’t there a distinction between collaboration and coordination? Mr. MOORE. I mean, I think, generally, yes. Mr. TIFFANY. I mean, isn’t coordination identified in the law, that it is a specific process in working with local municipalities? Mr. MOORE. Yes, it is about informing and being informed. Mr. TIFFANY. So, if 128 Land Management Plans are done under one EIS, how are you going to coordinate with all those local municipalities? Mr. MOORE. Well, it is going to be done at the local individual forest level. Our approach is we basically overhauled the whole planning process within the agency. So, we have three planning teams across the country: one in the West, one in the Midwest, and one in the East. And these teams will be doing most of the legwork on the analysis. And a part of the issue we have had in the agency, too, is that you don’t have the skill set at every forest to do this, and there is so much other work to be done. So, these national teams or these42 regional teams will take most of the brunt of the work from the forest, so they are not overly encumbered with a forest plan revision. Mr. TIFFANY. Let’s take one, for example, the Chequamegon- Nicolet National Forest in Wisconsin. Do you fully commit to coordinate with local units of government when creating this new plan? Mr. MOORE. Yes, that is an ordinary part of what we should be doing out there, Mr. Chairman. Mr. TIFFANY. Well, those folks are ready, willing, and able to work with you in regards to this, and I appreciate you making that commitment. And now, I am way overboard on Wisconsin time here, so I appreciate that you would take the additional time here to be as forthright as possible, and I appreciate you taking the time this morning, Chief Moore, to set a little time aside to have a real personal discussion in regards to this stuff. We will be doing some follow-up. We appreciate you and your staff engaging with us in regards to that, because we are inter- ested. It is clear that you are sincere about wanting to have the best outcomes possible, and we want to work with you to be able to do that. Members of the Subcommittee may have some additional ques- tions for you, and we will ask that the witness respond to these in writing. Under Committee Rule 3, members of the Subcommittee must submit questions to the Subcommittee Clerk by 5 p.m. on Friday, June 7, 2024. The hearing record will be held open for 10 business days for those responses. And if there is no further business, it sure doesn’t appear so, we are pretty lonely here, Mr. Chief, without objection, the Subcommittee on Federal Lands stands adjourned. [Whereupon, at 12:18 p.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.] Æ\n\n\nCHRG-118hhrg58381\nOVERSIGHT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPOR- TATION’S POLICIES AND PROGRAMS AND FIS- CAL YEAR 2025 BUDGET REQUEST (118–63) HEARING BEFORE THE COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ONE HUNDRED EIGHTEENTH CONGRESS SECOND SESSION JUNE 27, 2024 Printed for the use of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure ( Available online at: https://www.govinfo.gov/committee/house-transportation?path=/ browsecommittee/chamber/house/committee/transportation U.S. GOVERNMENT PUBLISHING OFFICE 58–381 PDF WASHINGTON : 2025 For sale by the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Publishing Office Internet: bookstore.gpo.gov Phone: toll free (866) 512–1800; DC area (202) 512–1800 Fax: (202) 512–2104 Mail: Stop IDCC, Washington, DC 20402–0001 VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00001 Fmt 5011 Sfmt 5011 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEANCOMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE SAM GRAVES, Missouri, Chairman RICK LARSEN, Washington, Ranking Member ERIC A. ‘‘RICK’’ CRAWFORD, Arkansas ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON, DANIEL WEBSTER, Florida District of Columbia THOMAS MASSIE, Kentucky GRACE F.

PURPOSE The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure will meet on Thursday, June 27, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. ET in 2167 of the Rayburn House Office Building to receive testimony at a hearing entitled, ‘‘Oversight of the Department of Transpor- tation’s Policies and Programs and Fiscal Year 2025 Budget Request.’’ The hearing will provide Members an opportunity to discuss all aspects of the United States De- partment of Transportation (DOT), including policy decisions, the fiscal year (FY) 2025 budget request, and program implementation. At the hearing, Members will receive testimony from DOT Secretary Pete Buttigieg. II. BACKGROUND UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Pursuant to House Rule X(1)(r), the Committee on Transportation and Infrastruc- ture (Committee) authorizes programs carried out by the following DOT modal ad- ministrations and offices: • Federal Aviation Administration (FAA); • Federal Highway Administration (FHWA); • Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA); • National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA); • Federal Transit Administration (FTA); • Federal Railroad Administration (FRA); • Maritime Administration (MARAD); • Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA); • Great Lakes Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation (GLS); • Office of the Secretary (OST); and • Office of the Inspector General (OIG) On December 15, 2020, President Biden nominated Pete Buttigieg to be the Sec- retary of Transportation.

FY 2025 BUDGET REQUEST The President’s FY 2025 Budget requests $109.3 billion for DOT, an increase of $1.7 billion, or 1.6 percent, compared to FY 2024 enacted levels.3 In addition, DOT will receive $36.8 billion in advance supplemental funding from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) (P.L. 117–58), bringing DOT’s total FY 2025 budg- etary resources to $146.2 billion.4 Of the requested funding, the President’s Budget proposes $21.8 billion for FAA, $62.8 billion for FHWA, $16.8 billion for FTA, $3.2 billion for FRA, $1.3 billion for NHTSA, $965 million for FMCSA, $860 million for MARAD, $401 million for PHMSA, $41 million for the GLS, $1.1 billion for OST, and $122 million for the OIG.5 DOT’s budget largely supports contract authority programs funded from the Highway Trust Fund and Airport and Airway Trust Fund, competitive grants, operations, and other modal administration spending. IV. ANALYSIS OF SELECT DOT POLICIES AND PROGRAMS IIJA On November 15, 2021, the President signed IIJA into law, representing the larg- est Federal investment in decades in the United States’ infrastructure.6 This legisla- tion authorized and appropriated a combined $1.2 trillion for infrastructure pro- grams over the five-year period from FY 2022 to FY 2026, to sustain and modernize the Nation’s infrastructure, including roads, bridges, transit, railroads, ports, and airports, as well as energy and broadband.7 Of the total funding authorized and ap- propriated in IIJA, approximately $661 billion is administered by DOT, for FY 2022 through FY 2026.8 This is more than twice the amount of funds authorized in the previous five-year authorization law.9 Since IIJA’s enactment, as of June 2, 2024, DOT has announced $318 billion in IIJA formula funding and grant awards to states, local governments, transit agen- cies, airports, ports, and other project sponsors.10 FHWA has distributed approxi- mately $164.6 billion under the Federal-aid Highways program and has announced another $29 billion in Highway Infrastructure Programs grants.11 Analysis of FHWA data by the American Road & Transportation Builders Association (ARTBA) indicates that states have committed to use these formula funds to support over 70,200 new projects, through March 31, 2024.12 Additionally, FTA has distributed approximately $43.1 billion in Transit Formula Grants funding and has announced another $18.9 billion in transit grants. FRA has announced nearly $36 billion in grants, FAA has announced $11.6 billion in airport funding, and OST has an- nounced approximately $9.5 billion in grants for various programs.13 See Appendix 1 Consideration of the Nomination of Peter Buttigieg to be Secretary of the United States Transp.

During a March 7, 2024, Full Committee hearing, the Committee received testi- mony indicating that there have been significant delays in the execution of grant agreements after grants have been announced. Any increase in project costs prior to grant agreement execution are absorbed by states, localities, and other grant re- cipients.14 Additionally, some witnesses suggested reforms to the grant making proc- ess, including that DOT should provide greater consistency and transparency in its processes for soliciting and awarding grants.15 FAA REAUTHORIZATION On May 15, 2024, the House passed H.R. 3935, the Federal Aviation Administra- tion Reauthorization Act of 2024, by a vote of 387 to 26.16 The bill was signed into law the following day.17 This legislation provides critical aviation safety enhance- ments, improves the flying public’s travel experience, ensures a robust general avia- tion sector, expands opportunities for America’s aviation workforce to grow, invests in infrastructure at airports of all sizes, and sets clear priorities for advancing the integration of new airspace entrants.18 DOT and FAA are now largely responsible for ensuring provisions of the law are effectively implemented in a timely manner. SELECT ONGOING NATIONAL SAFETY TRANSPORTATION BOARD (NTSB) INVESTIGA- TIONS Francis Scott Key Bridge On March 26, 2024, the DALI, a Singapore-flagged cargo vessel, collided with the Key Bridge in Baltimore, Maryland, resulting in the collapse of center spans of the Key Bridge into the Patapsco River and significant damage to the vessel.19 Prior to the collision, the pilot aboard the vessel issued a radio call that the DALI had lost power as it approached the Key Bridge.20 In response, a Maryland Transportation Authority (MDTA) police officer radioed two police officers on either side of the Key Bridge, resulting in the closure of all lanes with access to the Key Bridge and the cessation of bridge traffic, saving countless lives.21 Within the Committee’s jurisdiction, the initial Federal response involved the United States Coast Guard, the National Transportation Safety Board, the United States Army Corps of Engineers, and FHWA. FHWA’s actions fall under DOT’s pur- view. On March 28, 2024, FHWA received and approved an application from the Mary- land Department of Transportation (MDOT) for $60 million in Emergency Relief (ER) funding.22 These ‘‘quick release’’ funds are intended to help with initial emer- gency response and repair costs and may be released prior to completion of detailed damage inspections and cost estimates.23 According to FHWA, the $60 million rep- resents approximately five percent of the preliminary estimated project cost of $1.2 billion.24 The Maryland Transportation Authority (MDTA) has reportedly said the rebuild will cost between $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion, and the target for completion 14 Department of Transportation Discretionary Grants: Stakeholder Perspectives: Hearing Be- fore the H.

While the bridge was shielded as I–695, it was part of a larger segment that comprises Maryland State Route 695, which includes sections not on the Interstate Highway system, including the Key Bridge.34 According to FHWA, prior to its collapse, the facility never received any Federal funding.35 The Key Bridge was historically a toll facility, but because it did not receive Federal funds, it was never required to comply with Federal require- ments, including tolling requirements. However, upon MDOT’s receipt of ER fund- ing, the facility was considered ‘‘Federalized,’’ and became subject to all Title 23, United States Code, requirements going forward.36 On April 19, 2024, MDOT submitted an application to designate an 18.8-mile seg- ment of MD–695, which includes the Francis Scott Key Bridge, as part of the Inter- state System, and FHWA approved the application on April 29, 2024.37 The Federal share for permanent repairs for this event under the ER program under current law is 90 percent.38 On FHWA’s most recent report estimating unmet needs of the ER program, which shows estimated remaining payments from the Federal Government to a state for an event, not the total cost of each event, the state of Maryland esti- mates the current Federal share of the rebuild as of May 13, 2024, is $1.5 billion.39 Information provided by FHWA indicates that the assessment for the Key Bridge is still ongoing. FHWA’s most recent report indicates that there is a total unmet need for the ER program of $4.4 billion, with $886 million in available ER funding. This means there is an estimated $3.5 billion ‘‘backlog’’ (ER funding available minus unmet needs) in the ER program.40 However, because ER is a reimbursable pro- gram the Federal Government does not provide a state with lump sum payment, 25 Michael Laris and Erin Cox, Rebuilding Baltimore’s Key Bridge expected to cost up to $1.9 billion, WASH.

Fires from these cars then damaged an additional 12 non-derailed railcars. First responders implemented a one-mile evacuation zone surrounding the derailment site that affected up to 2,000 resi- dents.44 NTSB will hold its final board meeting on the East Palestine derailment on June 25, 2024.45 During the public meeting, NTSB board members will vote on the final report, including probable cause and safety recommendations.46 V.

SAM GRAVES OF MISSOURI, CHAIRMAN, COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND INFRA- STRUCTURE Mr. GRAVES OF MISSOURI. I want to thank you, Mr. Secretary, for being here today to discuss the Department of Transportation’s policies, programs, and fiscal year 2025 budget request. Last month, the House approved the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024 by a very strong, bipartisan vote of 387 to 26, and the Presi- dent signed it into law the following day. This legislation provides some critical aviation safety enhancements. It improves the flying public’s travel experience, ensures a robust general aviation sector, and expands opportunities for America’s aviation workforce to grow. It invests in infrastructure at airports of all sizes, and sets some clear priorities for advancing integration of new airspace en- trants. Congress gave the Federal Aviation Administration strong and decisive direction to help ensure America’s aviation system main- tains its gold standard, and I look forward to working with you, Mr. Secretary, and the FAA to ensure that this law is implemented in a timely and effective manner. Now that the committee has completed its work on FAA reau- thorization and has passed legislation out of committee to author- ize the Coast Guard, reauthorize our Nation’s pipeline safety pro- (1) VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00011 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6633 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN2 grams, and a WRDA bill, we must begin to contemplate the next surface transportation bill. We are more than halfway through the current authorization of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which authorized and appropriated nearly $661 billion for the Department of Transpor- tation, and I remain concerned about the slow pace at which the Department is distributing IIJA funds. Despite having received more than $364 billion since IIJA’s enactment, DOT has obligated a little more than half and outlaid only 27 percent of the available funds. We are not seeing the realization of project benefits that were ad- vertised following IIJA’s enactment. Earlier this year, we heard from witnesses who testified that delays in distributing IIJA grant funds has caused costs to balloon, ultimately forcing grant recipi- ents to absorb the increased costs or, unfortunately, in some cases, abandon the project entirely. We also, I think, have to consider ways to pay for those infra- structure investments, which includes addressing—and we are going to have to address—the Highway Trust Fund’s funding chal- lenges. The Congressional Budget Office most recently projected that the Highway Trust Fund is going to become insolvent in fiscal year 2028, and is going to face a cumulative shortfall of about $274 billion over the next decade. I think we must maintain the user pays principle, and find some solutions for putting the Highway Trust Fund on a more sustain- able fiscal path. The Department could do its part by more aggres- sively implementing the alternative funding pilot program, which is currently way behind schedule. But with that, I again very much want to thank you, Mr. Sec- retary, for being here today, and I look forward to a very produc- tive hearing.

With that, I again want to thank the Secretary for being with us today and I look forward to a productive hearing. Mr. GRAVES OF MISSOURI. And now I want to recognize Ranking Member Larsen for his opening statement. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RICK LARSEN OF WASH- INGTON, RANKING MEMBER, COMMITTEE ON TRANSPOR- TATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE Mr. LARSEN OF WASHINGTON. Thank you, Chair Graves, for hold- ing this hearing. And welcome back, Mr. Secretary, to answer questions and give us an update on DOT’s progress, as well as your budget. We have a large committee; we appreciate your time. Today, we are going to hear about how Federal funds provided by Congress and distributed by the DOT—how those funds are building a cleaner and greener, safer, and more accessible transpor- tation system. The BIL provides record funding for these infra- structure projects. States and local governments, Tribes, transit agencies, rail, airports, ports, travelers, and workers all benefit from this investment. Thanks to the BIL, 57,000 projects are un- derway in every congressional district across the country. The pace of grantmaking has been impressive. DOT has an- nounced $318 billion in grants since the enactment of the BIL, and the list is in the staff memo, I won’t go through it all, but there are a lot of dollars out there being spent right now, creating jobs. We are less than 3 years through a 5-year bill, which means there is more to come. And just this week, the Department an- nounced over $1.8 billion in Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity, or RAISE, grants for 148 projects across the country, including the Port of Bellingham, to modernize its shipping terminal in my district, and to the Tulalip Tribes to improve road safety on and near their reservation. And this week, DOT is also announcing the availability of the remainder of BIL culvert grant program funds, which my home State of Washington will be watching with great interest. Federal investment in Washington State and across the country means jobs—jobs with good wages, benefits, and working condi- tions. And the impacts have been clear. In 2023, the highway con- struction industry added 2,800 jobs per month—the highest rate of job creation since the Bureau of Labor Stats began tracking the data.

Yet transportation emissions continue to rise, and an epidemic of fatalities and injuries continues to plague our Nation’s roads. Ad- dressing these priorities will continue to be a high priority for com- mittee Democrats as we look forward to the reauthorization. On the FAA, as the chair noted, we passed a bill, had a strong bipartisan vote in the House and in the Senate. The legislation does a variety of things, including boosting airport project funding, advancing our leadership in aviation safety, and diversifying the aviation workforce. Provisions are now in the hands of DOT and, of course, the FAA, and we are eager to see the FAA turn these words into benefits for communities and aviation workers. Finally, I want to commend my fellow committee members, in- cluding Representative Emilia Sykes and Representative Chris Deluzio, who led the charge to improve railway safety. Rail inci- dents and accidents continue to occur around the country, endan- gering people and communities. In fact, in 2023, there were ap- proximately 1,500 train accidents. Just 2 days ago, the NTSB re- leased its findings from the Norfolk Southern derailment in East Palestine and confirmed the urgent need to address rail safety. So, I urge this committee to take long overdue action on rail safe- ty so passengers and communities with rail in their backyards have a level of safety oversight and protection afforded to other modes of transportation. We are going to hear a lot about many topics today, Mr. Sec- retary, and we look forward to your answers. With that, I will turn it back over to the chair, and we can get started on your testimony and Member questions. And with that, I yield back.

PETE BUTTIGIEG, SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Thank you very much, Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, and all members of the committee. I want to thank you for the opportunity to testify today and for your continued partnership. Before I begin, I do want to take a moment to remember Rep- resentative Donald Payne, Jr. He was a pleasure to work with. As you know, he was a constant champion for more accessible and re- silient transportation, and we will miss him. Just 3 years ago, I was making the case for the Bipartisan Infra- structure Law in front of this committee, and now we are in the middle of an infrastructure decade unlike anything this country has seen since the Eisenhower administration. I am proud to report that we are now supporting over 50,000 transportation projects in all 50 States, DC, Puerto Rico, and all U.S. Territories. Our coun- try has chosen to end decades of underinvestment, and I would like to share a few examples of what this new level of investment in infrastructure means to the American people and economy. I will start by mentioning the Brent Spence Bridge between Ken- tucky and Ohio, one of 9,400 bridge projects nationwide. Anyone who has traveled along I–71 and I–75 knows this bridge is a crit- ical thoroughfare. It is also one of the worst trucking bottlenecks in the country. Improvements have been talked about for years, and this administration is finally acting to make them happen. Just last month, the project cleared its comprehensive environ- mental review, and the construction that will upgrade the existing bridge and break ground on a new companion bridge will start soon. When it comes to rail, we are modernizing and upgrading our freight and passenger rail systems to make them safer. Across every region of the country, we are building new tunnels, expand- ing routes, and upgrading tracks. Through the Railroad Crossing Elimination Program, a first-of-its-kind initiative created by Presi- dent Biden’s infrastructure package, we are improving or elimi- nating over 400 railroad crossings. In addition to addressing the in- convenience of waiting for a train to pass, these projects are cre- ating safer crossings for drivers and pedestrians. We are also using our authority to make our freight rail system safer. Earlier this year, we issued final rules to require emergency escape breathing apparatus for trains carrying hazardous materials and to establish minimum safety requirements for traincrew size. We have conducted 7,500 focused inspections along high-hazard flammable train routes, issued safety advisories, and developed a new rule to require railroads to provide real-time information to first responders when a hazmat incident occurs. Turning to aviation, airports of all sizes are undergoing major upgrades to meet the increasing number of people flying. I have seen some of this work firsthand in recent months. I was in Geor- gia in April to celebrate a construction milestone for the new Ter- minal D at the Atlanta airport—done without major service disrup- tions, which is important for the busiest airport in the world. In May, I got to see the work going on at Missoula Airport in Montana, where they are updating an 80-plus-year-old terminal to VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00016 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6633 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN7 match current passenger capacity, and ultimately offer more flights, recruit more airlines, and keep travel costs down for pas- sengers. And under the leadership of FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker, we have refocused the oversight of Boeing and will continue to hold Boeing accountable as they carry out their action plan and regain trust on safety and quality improvements. A little over 2 weeks ago, I joined leaders in Maryland to mark the reopening of the Port of Baltimore. After the shocking collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in late March, we quickly released emergency funding to put toward rebuilding the bridge. We have worked closely with county, local, and State governments, as well as other partners to help mitigate the impact on our supply chains while that critical port was temporarily closed. And now, less than 100 days later, the Port of Baltimore is once again open and fully operational. Put simply, there is a lot of important work going on right now making communities more accessible, creating good-paying jobs across the country, and keeping our supply chains strong. And our work has helped lower the number of traffic fatalities on our roads for the past eight quarters, and continues to make all of our trans- portation systems safer for everyone who uses them. There is much more to be done, and we need the continued part- nership of this committee and of the Congress to fully realize the potential of this new infrastructure era. I want to thank this committee for getting the FAA reauthoriza- tion passed and to President Biden’s desk. Thanks to your bipar- tisan leadership, the FAA has vital resources that will further mod- ernize our aviation infrastructure and keep our aviation system as the safest and most efficient in the world. I am also pleased that this law protects the automatic refunds rule, and supports other consumer protection work this Depart- ment has fought so hard for, like getting rid of fees that parents have had to pay to sit next to their young children on a flight. Yet this country needs similar bipartisan leadership when it comes to rail safety. As I mentioned, the Department is doing ev- erything possible under our existing authority to upgrade and mod- ernize our rail infrastructure and make our operations safer. We need to set even higher standards, and we need Congress to pass the Railway Safety Act to make tracks, cars, and working condi- tions safer for those who work on freight rail, and to protect those who live in nearby communities. And I know we can get it done, because the last 31⁄2 years have been a testament to what is pos- sible when our Department works closely with this committee. With your partnership, we can keep this momentum going, deliver good projects for more communities, build and rebuild our transpor- tation systems to meet the 21st- and even 22nd-century needs of Americans. Thank you again, and I look forward to your questions.

The first one is starting at 10:30, and the Secretary has a hard stop. So, what I am asking is: Let’s be respectful of the Secretary’s time, and try to keep our questions to 5 minutes. Stay underneath our rules. So, with that, I am going to turn to Ranking Member Larsen for opening questions. Mr. LARSEN OF WASHINGTON. Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for com- ing today, I appreciate it. There is a lot of math out there in terms of how much you spent, how much hasn’t been spent, what is going on. By my math, we are about 52.8 percent of the way in terms of timeline to Sep- tember 30, 2026. Also by my math, the DOT has distributed about 48.1 percent of the dollars. So, pretty close. Not exact, but pretty close. Almost half and half. Can you talk a little bit about some of the challenges you have had getting dollars out the door and what you have done to address those challenges so communities can benefit from the dollars in the BIL? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Thank you, yes. As you noted, we are more or less right in the middle of the 5-year life of this authorization, and depending on how you measure, but by the most basic measure of funds flowing out, we made roughly half of the funding available. As you know, our funding works typically on a reimbursement basis, which means not only do we have to announce an award, but there needs to be an agreement making clear that Federal require- ments have been met for that project, and the project sponsor needs to undertake it, and then the dollars can be fully outlaid after obligation. But we have been trying to work within that to try to create flexibility where appropriate, with tools like pre-award authority, so that work can begin if, again, appropriate, and if the right checks and balances are there. We want to make sure that process is never a barrier to things getting done. There are a lot of challenges along the way: the complexity of the projects, supply chain and workforce challenges, given the enor- mous volume of work that we are doing. And while the overall number, from the best data that I can gather, the overall number of projects delivered now is on par with what we would have seen at this point in a previous administration.

We have stood up teams that I personally engage with and do a great deal of work under the hood to try to speed up those processes. Mr. LARSEN OF WASHINGTON. Are there specific actions that you can outline for us that you have taken with regards to that proc- ess? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Yes, I would point to the Center of Excel- lence that we have established on project delivery. We brought some of the best talent and some of the best data that we have to try to get that done. We have used steps like programmatic ap- proaches and sometimes combined NOFOs in order to have less redtape and fewer steps associated with the same number of projects. We have also undertaken a new level of technical assistance with our grant sponsors, because often it is the first time that they have done a Federal grant of this magnitude, especially the rural and Tribal communities that we have been working with. And so, through both structured programs like the Thriving Communities Program and just our running capacity for technical assistance, we are standing side by side with our project sponsors. The instructions I have given to our team is, even if the delay in some Federal process is coming from the State or the county or the city not yet being ready with something, we should take ownership of that and we should take responsibility for that and not just say, it is your problem, you fix it. We are going to be side by side with you, helping you navigate these processes, even while we are work- ing to make them simpler on the front end, which begins just with my quest to get NOFOs below 100 pages, which was not the norm we inherited. But it is just one small example of what we are try- ing to do to make this a more user-friendly Federal grant process. Mr. LARSEN OF WASHINGTON. Thanks. Moving to rail safety, and now that the NTSB had their hearing Tuesday, the report is out— I think we are being briefed tomorrow morning on the report, if I am not mistaken, here on the committee—has the Department looked at specific actions, legislative actions that we need to take versus any regulatory actions that the Department can take? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. We have undertaken a number of regu- latory actions, but, of course, are assessing the recommendations that have been made public, even though they haven’t been for- mally transmitted yet to us as a Department, to make sure that we are doing everything we can within our existing regulatory au- thority to keep freight rail safe. But the reality is, while we are going to keep doing everything we can short of an act of Congress, it is going to take an act of Con- gress to give us some of the tools that we need. I would point to two things in particular that I think are important that are con- templated in the bipartisan legislation that has been put forward and that we urge this committee and this Chamber to act on. One has to do with increasing the statutory caps on fines to put more teeth in our enforcement. Right now, they are capped in the neighborhood of $220,000, which just isn’t that much to a multibil- lion-dollar corporation.

My understanding of the information that has been made public by the NTSB is, if those tank cars had been in use, what happened in East Palestine might not have. Mr. LARSEN OF WASHINGTON. All right, thank you. I yield. Mr. GRAVES OF MISSOURI. Mr. Crawford. Mr. CRAWFORD. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for being here today. I want to ad- dress something that we have talked about before, and that is the Federal Highway Administration’s proposed greenhouse gas emis- sions performance measure to force State departments of transpor- tation and metropolitan planning organizations to cut carbon emis- sions stemming from transportation on the National Highway Sys- tem. You know that I have voiced my concerns about this in opposi- tion to this proposal, which demonstrably exceeds the administra- tion’s authority. The policy was specifically considered and disposed of during negotiation of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The Federal Highway Administration announced its final rule last November, despite not having the authority to do so, and, as a result, 22 States sued as part of 2 separate lawsuits. This spring, two Federal courts found that the rule exceeds the Federal High- way’s statutory authority. Yet now we learn that you are going to appeal that ruling. Can you tell us why? Why are you squandering time and re- sources to appeal a decision that has been adjudicated in court? And clearly, you had no authority to make that rule. So, explain that, if you would. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Sure. I am not going to comment on our courtroom strategy. What I will say is that any—— Mr. CRAWFORD [interrupting]. I am not asking for that. I am ask- ing for the sense behind why you are challenging the ruling when you clearly didn’t have the authority. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. We don’t believe that that is accurate. And of course, we will comply with any and all relevant court rulings. That is what we are doing in the meantime. Mr. CRAWFORD. Let me ask you this. How much is this setting you back? And by ‘‘you,’’ I mean the Department of Transportation. And by ‘‘Department of Transportation,’’ I mean the American tax- payer. How much is this costing? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. I haven’t seen a costing in terms of hours of work spent on this. Mr. CRAWFORD. That is a shame. You have got $661 billion to the Department of Transportation in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, $661 billion. And the things that we should be focus- ing on, like for example, parking spaces for truckdrivers—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [interrupting]. I am glad you raised that. As you probably know, we are building parking spaces for truck- drivers—— VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00021 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6633 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN12 Mr. CRAWFORD [interrupting]. I will get to that in a minute, but instead of spending the money on parking spaces, you are spending the money on appeals in the court system. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. The grant programs for parking spaces don’t come out of the same part of the budget as lawyers working on appeals, Congressman. Mr. CRAWFORD. Do you really think it is a good allocation of tax- payer resources to challenge a legal decision for which you had no authority to make a rule on? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Yes, anything we do—— Mr. CRAWFORD [interrupting]. You do? Secretary BUTTIGIEG [continuing]. We think is a good allocation of taxpayer resources, otherwise we wouldn’t do it. Mr. CRAWFORD. Well, I guess the taxpayers probably feel dif- ferently about it, because I hear about this all the time from folks in my district that actually build the highways. See, we are respon- sible for paying for the highways. You are responsible for making sure they are getting done. But the people who actually do the work, they have got a problem with this. Let me turn to another matter. Since I was first elected to Con- gress, I have worked to improve the safety of our Nation’s road- ways. The American public should remain confident that our pro- fessional commercial motor vehicle drivers are operating safely throughout the country. In 2011, I introduced the Safe Roads Act, which was incorporated into MAP–21 and the creation of the Fed- eral Motor Carrier Safety Administration’s national Drug and Alco- hol Clearinghouse. My Drug Free Commercial Driver Act, which was included in the FAST Act, would allow hair testing for CMV drivers, which is a much better way to ensure that habitual drug users are not oper- ating in safety critical roles. The Department of Health and Human Services continues to fail to implement that requirement, and I am going to continue to remind them to do their job. The Department of Justice just published a rulemaking seeking to reclassify marijuana from a schedule I narcotic to schedule III. Under current law, trucking and other safety critical transpor- tation workers are required to be tested for certain drugs, including marijuana. Marijuana continues to be the drug most frequently seen by CMV drivers in their testing reported to FMCSA Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse. The rescheduling and deregulation of mari- juana will inevitably cause the number of people driving impaired, while high, to grow. The American Trucking Associations has transmitted two letters to your agency highlighting these concerns. I would ask unanimous consent to submit those into the record.

Eric A. ‘‘Rick’’ Crawford MAY 15, 2024. The Honorable MERRICK GARLAND, Office of the Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice, 950 Pennsylvania Avenue N.W., Washington, DC 20530. The Honorable XAVIER BECERRA. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 200 Independence Avenue, S.W., Washington, DC 20201.

RE: Impact of Reported Marijuana Rescheduling on Public Safety and Safety-Sen- sitive Industries DEAR ATTORNEY GENERAL GARLAND, SECRETARY BECERRA, AND SECRETARY BUTTIGIEG: On behalf of the American Trucking Associations (ATA), I write to bring to your attention significant concerns about the reported forthcoming regulatory action by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to reschedule marijuana, or can- nabis, from a Schedule I to a Schedule III drug under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). Absent an explicit allowance for continued employer marijuana testing of safety-sensitive workers, this change may have considerable negative con- sequences for highway safety and safety-sensitive industries. While recent media reports surrounding DEA’s potential reclassification create many uncertainties, ATA is alarmed by the possibility that certain industries could be prohibited from screening for drug use by workers performing safety-sensitive roles. If the trucking and broader transportation industries’ ability to conduct drug testing is restricted, the risk of impaired drivers operating on our nation’s roadways undetected would increase, endangering all who share the road. As the largest na- tional trade association representing the interests of the trucking industry with more than 37,000 members, ATA remains focused on maintaining workplace and roadway safety through effective countermeasures like employer drug testing. Recent news reports indicate DEA is seeking to reschedule marijuana from its current Schedule I to a proposed Schedule III status as set out by the CSA—effec- tively regrouping marijuana from the drug class considered having the highest ‘‘po- tential for abuse and the potential to create severe psychological and/or physical de- pendence,’’ alongside drugs like heroin and LSD, to a category of drugs considered ‘‘less dangerous’’ with low to moderate potential for abuse, such as ketamine or co- deine. Although this purported change would not outright legalize marijuana at the federal level, it would largely deregulate marijuana for medical use, create ambi- guity and confusion around state-level recreational marijuana legalization and use, and result in serious safety impacts to safety-sensitive industries. ATA recognizes that the implications of the policy change DEA is reportedly con- sidering cannot be fully understood in the absence of a formal rule, and at this time, judgments on what and how this may occur remain speculative. However, resched- uling marijuana could significantly affect the Department of Transportation’s (DOT) responsibility and ability to ensure the safety of the national transportation net- work. As outlined in 49 CFR Part 40, DOT is required to conduct workplace drug and alcohol testing for federally regulated transportation industries. DEA’s potential regulatory action has serious ramifications because it could alto- gether eliminate employers’ ability to conduct and report marijuana testing of DOT- designated ‘‘safety-sensitive’’ workers—including commercial truck and bus drivers, pilots, train operators, and other transportation workers—that are currently subject to DOT drug and alcohol testing regulations. Current DOT drug and alcohol testing requirements are governed—and therefore limited in their testing authority—by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Mandatory Guidelines for Fed- eral Workplace Drug Testing Programs, which allow regulated employers to test VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00023 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN14 only for those drugs listed in Schedule I or II of the CSA.1 2 Therefore, without addi- tional action, deregulation or rescheduling of marijuana would have the likely con- sequence of precluding testing for all professional drivers and transportation work- ers as part of the DOT testing program. ATA believes it is critical to the safety of our nation’s traveling public and all transportation industry members that any change in the law must be accompanied by an explicit allowance for the testing of marijuana use by DOT-regulated safety- sensitive groups. As of March 2024, marijuana represented around 60 percent of all positive employer drug tests of regulated CMV drivers reported to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration’s (FMCSA) Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse.3 While ATA acknowledges the prevalence and increasing societal acceptance of marijuana for medical and recreational purposes, absent an impairment standard, testing for marijuana use by safety-sensitive employees must remain in place. Just last year, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) released research showing that marijuana and alcohol remain the most-detected drugs in impaired driving crashes resulting in serious or fatal injuries.4 A separate study published in the National Journal of Medicine revealed that state-level marijuana legalization ‘‘was associated with a 6.5% increase in injury crash rates and a 2.3% increase in fatal crash rates.’’ 5 Last summer, a truck driver in Indiana fatally collided with a series of vehicles, killing seven; the driver’s toxicology report ultimately showed marijuana in his sys- tem at the time of the crash.6 And just this year, in Buda, Texas, a cement truck driver who admitted to ingesting marijuana the night prior—among other drugs in the preceding hours—veered head-on into a school bus carrying pre-K children, kill- ing one child as well as the driver of another vehicle and injuring nearly a dozen others.7 Rescheduling marijuana without an explicit drug testing carveout for safe- ty-sensitive workers could ultimately lead to more devastating tragedies like these and add to the ever-increasing death toll on our nation’s roadways. Further, an accurate and reliable standard and test for determining impairment— rather than intoxication—from marijuana consumption (like the blood alcohol con- tent measure used to detect alcohol impairment) does not yet exist. While perceived intoxication may only last a few hours, cognitive impairment from marijuana—im- pacting core motor skills, coordination, perception, and peripheral vision that are critical to safe, focused driving—has been found to last up to 24 hours in some in- stances.8 Thus, in the absence of an impairment standard, it remains critically im- portant that employers retain the ability to test for marijuana use in safety-sen- sitive contexts like trucking. While we recognize the speculative nature of our concerns until the DEA releases a formal rule, ATA believes that it is vitally important that your agencies ensure an ongoing allowance for marijuana testing of safety-sensitive workers to avoid dete- rioration of highway safety. If this rulemaking is permitted to move forward without appropriate regulatory review, oversight, and deliberation, ATA is concerned that it will severely curtail the ability of motor carriers and other employers of safety-sen- sitive positions to maintain a safe working environment, threatening the safety of all road users. 1 Under current law, DOT must ‘‘incorporate the Department of Health and Human Services scientific and technical guidelines’’ (i.e., the Mandatory Guidelines. 49 U.S.C. § 31306(c)(2)) ‘‘for laboratories and testing procedures for controlled substances.’’ See also Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs, 88 Fed.

Pete Buttigieg, U.S. Department of Trans- portation, from Dan Horvath, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Safety Policy, American Trucking Associations, Submitted for the Record by Hon. Eric A. ‘‘Rick’’ Crawford JUNE 20, 2024. The Honorable PETE BUTTIGIEG, U.S. Department of Transportation, 1200 New Jersey Ave. S.E., Washington, DC 20590. DEAR SECRETARY BUTTIGIEG: In light of the U.S. Department of Justice’s (DOJ) May 21st, 2024, proposal to transfer marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III drug under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), I write on behalf of the American Trucking Associations (ATA) 1 to request information regarding whether the U.S. Department of Transpor- tation (DOT) will maintain the authority and means to conduct testing of marijuana use by commercial motor vehicle (CMV) drivers and other safety-sensitive transpor- tation workers. As stressed in ATA’s May 15th letter to DOJ, DOT, and the Depart- ment of Health and Human Services (HHS), it is critical for transportation safety that we maintain the scope and scrutiny of testing that currently exists for individ- uals engaged in safety-sensitive industries, including commercial trucking, bussing, airlines, and rail. This is imperative given the current absence of a proven impair- ment standard. While ATA does not maintain a formal position on marijuana legalization or the ongoing testing of non-safety sensitive employees under HHS’s Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs, we remain concerned about the broad public health and safety consequences of reclassification on the national highway system and its users. ATA commends the DOT’s focused efforts to combat drug- and alcohol-impaired driving as part of its robust national roadway and transportation system safety ini- tiatives, specifically through effective programs like its DOT Drug & Alcohol Testing Program and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration’s (FMCSA) Drug & Alcohol Clearinghouse. Though ATA understands that the process and content of DOJ’s rulemaking falls outside the purview of DOT, we believe DOT and ATA share the goals of achieving zero highway fatalities and ensuring the commercial driving workforce is qualified to safely operate on our nation’s roadways. Last year, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) released a study showing that marijuana and alcohol remain the most detected drugs in impaired driving crashes resulting in serious or fatal injuries.2 Similarly, researchers at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism found that, between 2000 and 2018, crash deaths involving marijuana more than doubled, from 9% to 21.5%.3 Sep- arate studies revealed that state-level marijuana legalization ‘‘was associated with a 6.5% increase in injury crash rates and a 2.3% increase in fatal crash rates,’’ 4 while immediately following Canada’s 2018 legalization of marijuana, the country’s emergency rooms saw a 94% increase in the rate of marijuana-involved traffic inju- 1 ATA is a united federation of motor carriers, state trucking associations, and national truck- ing conferences created to promote and protect the interests of the trucking industry, with more than 37,000 members.

While ATA stresses the importance of continued marijuana testing across all transportation modes, within the CMV industry alone, marijuana continues to lead as the drug most frequently used by drivers. As of May 2024, marijuana (Δ9–THCA) represented around 60 percent—150,647 total—of all positive employer drug tests of regulated CMV drivers since the January 2020 implementation of the FMCSA Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse. Given the ongoing prevalence of marijuana use among commercial drivers and the preventability of tragedies caused by marijuana- impaired driving, like those cited in our May 15th, 2024 correspondence, ATA re- spectfully seeks additional information on DOT’s efforts to engage DOJ, HHS, and other federal partners to ensure that any change in the law regarding the status and legality of marijuana use is accompanied by an explicit allowance for the testing of marijuana use by DOT-regulated safety-sensitive workers. As you are aware, DOT is required by statute to rely on the HHS Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs for the certification of lab- oratories to carry out its DOT Drug and Alcohol Testing Programs.6 ATA remains concerned about the ensuing impact that rescheduling may have on HHS’s labora- tory certification process and promulgation of testing procedures, specifically for marijuana. While ATA recognizes that scientific and laboratory certification proc- esses intrinsic to employee drug testing fall outside DOT’s scope, we nevertheless urge you to work with HHS and relevant lawmakers to ensure ongoing marijuana testing, guidance, and laboratory certification for the DOT programs. The safety of our drivers and the motoring public is a chief priority to ATA, and we again applaud the DOT’s focus on drug- and alcohol-impaired driving prevention and, more broadly, national transportation system safety. Given the seemingly inev- itable increase in marijuana-impaired driving following a federal rescheduling, ATA is committed to working with DOT and other stakeholders to prevent marijuana- related crashes and fatalities. Thank you for your consideration of this vital safety issue, and we look forward to continued dialogue and partnership together in addressing it. Sincerely, DAN HORVATH, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Safety Policy, American Trucking Associations. cc: The Honorable Polly Trottenberg, Deputy Secretary, U.S. Department of Trans- portation Sue Lawless, Acting Deputy Administrator, Federal Motor Carrier Safety Admin- istration Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Secretary, I think it is safe to assume that the number of all impaired drivers on our roadways would increase with that ruling. Can you speak to what your Department is doing to ensure that transportation workers in safety-reliant positions can continue to be tested for marijuana use if this proposal goes forward, and how your Department plans to address transportation safety in light of DOJ’s rulemaking? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Thank you, yes. Any impaired driving, be it alcohol, marijuana, or any other source of impairment is, of course, a major safety concern. Our understanding of the rescheduling of marijuana from sched- ule I to schedule III is that it would not alter DOT’s marijuana testing requirements with respect to the regulated community. For private individuals who are performing safety-sensitive functions subject to drug testing, marijuana is identified by name, not by ref- erence to one of those classes. So, even if it moves in its classifica- 5 Myran, Daniel T, et al., ‘‘Cannabis-Involved Traffic Injury Emergency Department Visits after Cannabis Legalization and Commercialization,’’ JAMA network open, September 5, 2023, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10483310/. 6 49 U.S.C. §31306(c)(2).

Likewise, I should mention for Federal employees, including any DOT employees who have a security clearance or a safety-sensitive position, we do not understand that to be changed—any drug test- ing requirement relevant to that to be changed based on the reclas- sification decision. But we are continuing to evaluate any indirect impacts that it might have. Mr. CRAWFORD. Thanks. I yield back. Mr. GRAVES OF MISSOURI. Congresswoman Napolitano. Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Secretary Buttigieg, I reiterate the invitation for you to visit the 31st Congressional District in California again. But as you know, Los Angeles is preparing for the 2028 Olym- pics, representing the ninth time our Nation has hosted the world’s greatest sporting event. DOT is aware of the scale and scope of games to be hosted by southern California in 2028. What steps are you taking or do you envision taking to make sure the mobility plan for the athletes, officials, and fans is fully supported by DOT, sir? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. We are enthusiastic, of course, about the Olympics coming to the United States. I have met with L.A. 28 leaders and leaders from the region. We want to make sure that we are teaming up well with the Olympic Committee and the city, everybody who is involved because, of course, one of the most com- plex dimensions of running the Olympic Games is getting people to where they need to be. They have an ambitious vision for making newly borrowed tran- sit vehicles from around the country available. We are working with them on that through our Federal Transit Administration, and welcome opportunities to work with Congress, too, to make sure the right resources are in place. Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Wonderful. I know that the last time the Olympics were hosted in L.A., they talked about nighttime driving of delivery trucks. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. I am sorry? Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Nighttime driving, the delivery trucks, night- time. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Yes. Yes, we want to make sure that that is available, as well. And we think the partnerships with our De- partment and the technical assistance, including experience gained from prior iterations, is going to be helpful here. Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Thank you. The BIL law, we approved funding and requirements for the in- stallation of protective shields in buses to prevent assault on bus- drivers. How has the provision been implemented? And have there been obstacles to improving safety measures for busdrivers from passengers? We hear they want more protection now. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. We are very focused on making sure that we support both transit worker safety and rider safety. And in my discussions with operators and their representatives, there is cer- tainly an interest in the physical dimension of that.

We have also up- dated the National Public Transportation Safety Plan to enhance the guidance on how to make sure that systems are performing adequately and that we have some visibility on that. We finalized a rule known as the PTASP, the Public Transpor- tation Agency Safety Plans regulation that has a number of re- quirements, including performance targets, the advancement of systems, as you mentioned, that can help protect riders and work- ers, as well as things like de-escalation training, but with a real focus on making sure that we protect workers and riders. And we welcome further opportunities to do so, partnering with this com- mittee. Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Great, because we had a hearing here in Washington years ago, and many of the drivers indicated they were assaulted in various ways, and they want more protection. Well, we passed some requirement, but is it enough? Has it been enough? Are they requiring more now? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. I think it is safe to say that we have raised the bar with the new rule. But part of what the rule is doing is laying out standards or tools for the transit agencies themselves to use. So, we really need to maintain a partnership. We will keep work- ing to set not just a floor, but a set of best practices as we can at the Federal level, but we really need to work agency by agency, knowing that the needs are going to be different, the conditions are going to be different. But the commitment is absolutely the same, which is to make sure that anyone operating one of these transit vehicles knows that they are safe because they deserve a dignified as well as a safe workplace. People count on them to get to where they are going; they ought to be able to count on that basic level of safety. Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Thank you very much. DOT recently provided an update to the Justice40 initiative. The Department has exceeded its goal of delivering 40 percent of the benefits of Federal investments to disadvantaged communities. We applaud the agency for doing it, ensuring the funds from BIL to communities that have been historically neglected by the Federal Government. Can you elaborate in 20 seconds or more the imple- mentation? How does the Department plan to build on the successes of Justice40? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. To us, Justice40 is a way of keeping a promise that the President has made that communities that were overburdened and underserved, especially with regard to past rounds of transportation investment, get their due. And that is what led to that 40 percent commitment, that at least that many of the investments going out to clean energy and transportation would go to such communities. Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Thank you, sir. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Oh, are we out of time? OK. Mrs. NAPOLITANO. I yield back. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. I will be happy to share more in writing. Mr. GRAVES OF MISSOURI. Mr. Perry.

Mr. Secretary, I want to begin by giving credit where credit is due. I want to thank you for visiting south-central Pennsylvania, and providing some attention to that. And, of course, you are prob- ably aware, as you probably or likely crossed the South Bridge across the Susquehanna River, we have got a big construction project there, bipartisan support, and I would just encourage your continued attention and support of that. I want to turn to the electric vehicle market, as you can imagine. It seems to me that the industry is in a bit of a tailspin, and the Government-funded EV bubble appears to be deflating, even though we are subsidizing it to the tune of billions of dollars. The fact of the matter is 98 percent of all the cars on the road today are traditionally powered, 97 percent of the annual car purchases are traditionally powered. I know you are likely to talk about the 7-percent share of new car sales being EVs, but the truth of the matter is that it belies the fact that three-quarters of those car sales are used vehicles which aren’t EVs. And the cost of those grows every single day as EV costs go higher, driving the cost of traditional vehicle sales higher. The Energy Information Administration has found that the U.S. share of electric vehicles dropped in Q1 of 2024, and the context is tens of billions of dollars being showered down on the industry, and still this is happening. We are literally paying folks to produce the cars and sell the cars and buy the cars. But the consumer sen- timent continues to be moving away. Now, according to McKinsey and Company, your former em- ployer, nearly half, 46 percent, of electric vehicle owners are likely going back to traditional fuel vehicles. Consumer Report found EVs to be associated with 79 percent more problems than conventional vehicles. J.D. Power found customer satisfaction declining across the board, especially regarding level 2 charging, with roughly 20 percent of attempted charges ending without success. I can’t imag- ine going to the gas station 20 percent of the time leaving empty. Cox Automotive found that EV inventory is nearly twice that of the overall market, and 3,500 car dealers, some of which visited me and I represent, sent a letter begging you and the administration to stop these mandates. Now, recognizing that attempts to bribe the industry and the public into EV adoption have literally failed at this point—contin- ued mandating CAFÉ standards, EPA tailpipe standards that are de facto EV mandates, and ideological allies in 12 States are seek- ing to ban the sale of non-EV cars—now, we can talk about the proper role of Government. That would be a great conversation, be- cause I don’t think that we have the authority or should have the authority to limit what consumers can buy in this regard or what they can own. But clearly, Mr. Secretary, this isn’t working. So, I am won- dering, is there some point—and if you have identified some point—where you will stop, where the administration will stop, where the Federal Government will stop this requirement, and let the market decide, as opposed to the central planning model and this dictatorial policy?

Given time is limited, I will confine myself to addressing the factually incorrect portions of what you have said, beginning with the assertion that EV sales are going down. They are, in fact, going up—— Mr. PERRY [interrupting]. Does that include the Government sales, or—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [continuing]. Every single year—— Mr. PERRY [continuing interruption]. Private sales? Secretary BUTTIGIEG [continuing]. Every single year—— Mr. PERRY [continuing interruption]. Private sales or Govern- ment—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [continuing]. More Americans have pur- chased EVs. Mr. PERRY [continuing interruption]. Sales, Mr. Secretary? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. The entire market, overall—— Mr. PERRY [interrupting]. The Government is forced to buy them, so, sales are going up. But private sector—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [interrupting]. No, private sales, too, yes. Mr. PERRY. I would like those numbers. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Sure, 1.2 million EVs were sold in the U.S. in 2023. Mr. PERRY. How many Government and how many private? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. We will get you that breakout, but, as you know, more private citizens buy EVs than Government purchases. Mr. PERRY. No, I don’t know that. I don’t think—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [interrupting]. Let me address the second factual mistake in your remarks, which was that EV costs are get- ting higher. They are in fact getting lower and, according to J.D. Power, have now reached parity or are slightly lower than—— Mr. PERRY [interrupting]. With or without subsidy—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [continuing]. The equivalent gas-powered car. Mr. PERRY [continuing interruption]. Mr. Secretary? With or without—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [interrupting]. That does—yes, that does in- clude the subsidy. That is right. But the point is they are going lower—— Mr. PERRY [interrupting]. But they are not, because we are all buying—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [continuing]. Your statement that they are going up is incorrect. Mr. PERRY. We are all paying for them. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. The third incorrect assertion you made is that sales dropped in Q1. They did not drop compared to Q1 of the previous year. Of course, if you compare them to Q4, they dropped because they always do, because car sales are seasonal. But I would imagine most people are aware of that. Mr. PERRY. No, I am talking about—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [interrupting]. And fourth, I want to ad- dress—— Mr. PERRY [continuing]. In particular, EV Q4 to Q1, EV. Not just overall car sales. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Any car sales go down Q1 to Q4 because more people buy cars in Q4.

And the word ‘‘tailspin’’ is just a bizarre word to use for a growing sector of our economy. We also think that, since that is the way that the market is headed, we should not allow China to build on the advantage that they developed during the Trump administration, not because they are environmentalists, but because they understand the economic power of trying to dominate the EV market. We want those EVs to be made in America, and increasingly they are. Mr. PERRY. I am happy to have them made in America, Mr. Sec- retary. What I am not happy about is the mandate. The American people should be able to buy—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [interrupting]. That brings me to the fourth and final thing—— Mr. PERRY [continuing]. Any vehicle that they want. Secretary BUTTIGIEG [continuing interruption]. That I need to challenge as being factually inaccurate, which is there is no man- date. You can purchase a gas car if you want to pay gas prices at the pump. But if you don’t, you can purchase an EV with our help. Mr. GRAVES OF MISSOURI. We are going to try to get one more question in. Mr. Cohen. Mr. COHEN. Thank you. Secretary Buttigieg, thank you for coming, Mr. Secretary. I ap- preciate your coming and testifying, and it is always good to see you and discuss America’s needs and Memphis’ needs, which are America’s needs, as you well know. Your Department and your leadership have made tireless efforts and been instrumental in ad- vancing our infrastructure. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, we have had the most significant investment in infrastructure in decades, address- ing critical needs in our roads, bridges, transit systems, and more. I thank you and President Biden and those that voted for this bill. Several discretionary grant programs such as the Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity discre- tionary grant program, RAISE, important, just funded a program, which I appreciate, in my district that completed the Wolf River Greenway, a 26-mile pedestrian and bicycle path that needed to be completed. And it is a great opportunity for people to get exercise and get away from some communities and get into better natural surroundings. And we passed almost unanimously—not unanimously, but with great bipartisan support—the FAA reauthorization. Those improve- ments were needed yesterday, but we have got them now. Let me ask you about the I–55 bridge. I know you have heard from multiple stakeholders in my district about the bridge invest- ment program to replace the I–55 bridge. Only two bridges cross the Mississippi River in Memphis, one of which you came to Mem- phis to see, the I–40, when it was closed for several months be- cause of problems and basically caused by Arkansas not inspecting it well, but now it is clear we need a new bridge. This was built at a time when there were not—it was before the Interstate High- way System, so, it didn’t have any interstate highway levels of pro- VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00031 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6633 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN22 tection and stats. And it was before we had seismic vulnerabilities for older bridges. The bridge investment program is very competitive, I under- stand, but this is an important bridge for America. Can you give me any idea of when the FHWA ratings will be shared with appli- cants, and when funding might be announced? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Thank you. As you noted, I had an oppor- tunity to see for myself the critical importance of the I–55 bridge, both for individuals and for America’s supply chains. And we are conscious that that bridge project has approached the Department in the bridge investment program. Right now, Federal Highway is going through its process with a preliminary review and rating, and then a dialogue with applicants that gives them an opportunity to supplement their applications based on anything they have learned. We reached out to Ten- nessee’s DOT earlier this year to provide some of that feedback and then continue that process. I also want to note that any highly recommended or rec- ommended bridge project application that doesn’t give an award in the year when it comes in will be automatically carried forward for consideration under the next fiscal year, unless they opt out. In terms of timing, we are working through it right now for the 2023–2024 cycle, hoping to make a round of awards later on this summer. And again, we are very conscious of the importance of that particular opportunity for the community in the region. Mr. COHEN. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Passenger rights has been an important part of my service on this committee, and I know you have done a lot with it, and I thank you for your recent rules on fee transparency and cash re- funds for flight cancellations. What do the implementation timelines and enforcement of these rules look like? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. So, the rulemakings each have their own clock, typically 6 months or less, to comply. Although I will note that the refund provisions that were included in the FAA reauthor- ization go into effect right away. And so, it is simply a matter of us aligning the mechanisms to be able to do so, which we are work- ing to do promptly. We are proud of our record on passenger protection. We know there is always more work to do, as well. And so, we are continuing rulemakings on topics like making sure that you don’t have to pay extra to sit next to your kid on a flight, and looking into the issue of compensating passengers for extreme delays, in addition to—— Mr. COHEN [interrupting]. Can you pay extra for not sitting next to somebody else’s kid? [Laughter.] Mr. COHEN. Let me ask you about the airplane seat sizes, which is something I have worked on for many, many years, trying to— they have gotten smaller and more crowded. There were 26,000 comments about the discomfort of current seat sizes. Given your re- cent efforts to improve the passenger experience, nothing could be more important than a comfortable seat. Can you assure us that seat width and pitch do not will not get smaller? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. We continue to assess what our authorities might be in this regard. I can certainly assure you, as a frequent VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00032 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6633 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN23 flier, that I have experienced the squeeze you are describing. And, of course, in order for us to undertake regulatory action, it would need to align with one of our statutory authorities. FAA has looked into some of the safety implications of that. Mr. COHEN. Let me just ask you this. When they do the study, they—last time they didn’t have anybody over 60 or 65—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [interposing]. Yes. Mr. COHEN [continuing]. And nobody under 18, nobody with a disability, nobody with a dog. Can you make sure it looks like the flying public? That was an absurd test they did. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. We are conscious of the limitations under the study that was run before, and we will certainly hold that in mind going into any future study or simulation. Mr. COHEN. And my last—Safe Streets. Memphis was, unfortu- nately, first in pedestrian deaths, and we need more Safe Streets money. And we want to—I know you are dying to ride the train from Memphis to Nashville to Atlanta, and I look forward to doing it with you. I yield back the balance of my time. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Likewise, thank you. Mr. GRAVES OF MISSOURI. I knew the Cohen row of seats was going to come up at some point in this hearing. [Laughter.] Mr. GRAVES OF MISSOURI. With that, we do have a vote series going on, and I apologize to you, Mr. Secretary, for this. They obvi- ously didn’t consult us when it came to timing of the votes. But we will stand in recess until we finish, and hopefully that will be sooner, rather than later. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Thank you, Chairman. Mr. GRAVES OF MISSOURI. The committee stands in recess. [Recess.] Mr. WESTERMAN [presiding]. We are reconvening the previously recessed hearing. As a reminder, Members should limit their remarks to the allot- ted 5 minutes. With that, I recognize myself for 5 minutes of ques- tions. And Secretary Buttigieg, I am hearing from constituents that they are concerned about a potential port strike across the entire east and gulf coast ports if a contract agreement is not reached by September 30. This will be devastating for Arkansas businesses that rely on the ports to move their import and exports to cus- tomers. We are 90 days out, and I have learned that the negotia- tions have been called off. This is alarming, and it is up to the Biden administration to bring the parties back to the table to avert this economic catastrophe in September. What are your plans to make sure a port strike doesn’t happen? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Thank you. Yes, this is something we are monitoring closely, and our message to the parties is that it is vital that they come together and arrive at a deal that does right by port workers and allows port operations to flow. We had a similar level of intense negotiations around the west coast ports with ILWU. That came to a successful conclusion.

So, you are optimistic there is not going to be a shutdown? Because people have to plan way in advance for alternate routes and things. So—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [interrupting]. Yes, yes, we can’t speak for the parties, but of course we are urging them to get to a deal before that September 30 date. Mr. WESTERMAN. Good. So, earlier this year, the Federal High- way Administration issued a proposed rule that would waive Fed- eral regulations governing the procurement and administration of engineering and design services by local governments. Now, I have heard serious concerns from engineering companies about the po- tential impact of this change, which could undermine the long- standing and successful qualifications-based selection process that has been the Federal standard for decades. I appreciate the Department’s interest in easing administrative burdens on local governments that receive Federal grants. But as a professional engineer—and I think maybe the only one in Con- gress—I am concerned about the potential drawbacks of this par- ticular proposal. Studies have shown that hiring most qualified en- gineering companies saves time and money, and results in better projects and more satisfied owners. The QBS method also gives small and minority-owned firms an even playing field to compete, based on their specific proficiencies. It is my understanding that more than 740 public comments were filed in nearly unanimous opposition to the FHWA proposal. Can you please ensure that the administration will carefully con- sider the views of the engineering community and the potential negative impact of the proposed rule on public safety and project cost? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Yes, I will take care to look into that, and we want to make sure that anything we do that affects the rela- tionships with the engineering community is responsible and con- ducive to good, effective, safe project delivery. Mr. WESTERMAN. And I want to shift gears a little bit and talk about carbon emissions, carbon reductions. I know that is some- thing that you care about. And can you tell us what percentage of the world’s carbon emissions does the U.S. produce? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. I think it is less than one-fifth, depending on how you count it, of which the single biggest economic sector is transportation. Mr. WESTERMAN. Right, so, the Government data says 13.49, 13.5 percent is from the U.S. And like you said, the biggest sector is transportation. What is the percentage of that? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. I don’t have that off the top of my head, sorry. Mr. WESTERMAN. It is 29 percent. So, if we take 29 percent of 13.5 percent, that gets us down to between 3 and 4 percent of glob- al emissions come from U.S. transportation. What percentage of that is passenger cars and light-duty vehicles? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. So, I know it is one of the single largest categories. I don’t have a percentage breakout for you.

It is about 57 percent of that. So, if we take 57 percent of that second number, we are down around 2 percent. So, if every internal combustion engine vehicle in the United States was magically converted to an EV overnight, what would that say the potential to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions would be? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. By that logic, Congressman, none of us should ever vote. We are all doing our part to do something about a global change, and I believe America should lead the world. Mr. WESTERMAN. I disagree with you on that. We should vote smartly. We should put smart policy in place. And last count, we tried to find the number, over 120-and-some-odd billion taxpayer dollars have been put in subsidies for EVs. Now, that is if all the fuel going into these EVs came from noncarbon-emitting sources. Do you know how much electricity in the United States comes from noncarbon-emitting sources? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Even if all of that electricity came from fos- sil sources, it would still be cleaner because EV engines are more efficient. Mr. WESTERMAN. I think you need to go back and look at physics a little bit—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [interrupting]. OK, the physics, Congress- man, are that an EV engine is 90 percent efficient, where even the best ICE engines are lucky to get to 40 percent. Mr. WESTERMAN. But the plant that made the energy is not 90 percent efficient. And internal combustion engines are 25 to 30 per- cent efficient, but you have got the efficiency of the generating plant plus the losses in transmission. And don’t try to make the ef- ficiency argument. The bottom line is—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [interrupting]. Well, I am definitely going to try to make the efficiency argument, because I think it is impor- tant. Mr. WESTERMAN. Well, use good data if you are going to do that. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Sure. Well, the good data is that between the regenerative braking and the 77 percent—— Mr. WESTERMAN [interrupting]. Yes, you are talking about once the energy is in the—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [continuing]. Efficiency you get before that, you get to about 90 percent. Mr. WESTERMAN. Once the energy is in the EV. But the bottom line is only 40 percent of energy in the United States comes from noncarbon-emitting sources. So, that 2 percent—if you could make every vehicle in the United States an EV overnight, you would be less than 0.9 percent of the world’s global greenhouse gas emis- sions, and we are creating great turmoil and change in our country with taxpayer dollars being spent inefficiently. I am all for EVs, but let the technology catch up, and don’t try to ban internal combustion engines at the rate that you are doing. I am out of time, and I yield back and recognize the gentleman from California, Mr. Garamendi, for 5 minutes. Mr. GARAMENDI. I thank you, Mr. Chairman. Boy, would I love to spend the next hour on that debate, and get that information out there. I will point out that the petroleum in- dustry has been subsidized for the better part of 120 years, and continues to this day to have very, very significant subsidies.

I am thinking back on the very first days of the Biden administration, within a few months the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act became law. After 4 years, where the previous President said we are going to do an infrastructure bill, it never happened in the pre- vious administration, but during your tenure it did. And thank you so very much for your very significant leadership in making it happen, and also picking up a very, very important part of an American policy, and that is: make it in America, buy American. And I know that you have worked hard on that through- out. It was one of the major pieces of the legislation, and it is going into place. However, all of that seemed to have been held in abeyance by a waiver to a 1983 law that waived the Buy America requirements for transportation. So, the good news is, you are well into solving that problem. A couple of months ago, actually about a year ago, several of us brought to your attention this waiver, general waiver of the Buy America requirements of the 1983 law. My under- standing is that you have a proposed rule out to terminate that waiver. And I understand that the finalization may be in progress. Could you please bring us up to date on that? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Thank you. Yes, Congressman, we are very focused on making sure that we square the need for swift and effi- cient project delivery with our administration’s commitment to make sure that, when we use American taxpayer dollars, it is buy- ing things that are using materials made in America. We recognize that that is a long game because we are building for gaps in our manufacturing base that won’t be filled overnight. But we know that we have an opportunity here to build those in- dustries through both the demand and the rules that we have. Right now, DOT and the operating administrations are working to provide guidance over the guidance that came out from OMB to help specify any answers to questions that project sponsors might have, knowing that there is a lot of complexity to this. To be clear, some waivers may be required, but they will be lim- ited, targeted, and conditional, and only offered when we are con- fident that it is the right thing to do and still does right by our overall goals to build American capacity. Mr. GARAMENDI. Thank you for that. Those of us that have been on the Buy America train/road for the better part of our careers are going to watch very closely about the breadth of those waivers and the length of them. Short-term waivers, perhaps necessary, but if they become long-term waivers then we have accomplished nothing on the Buy America, make it in America, and rebuilding our indus- try. I want to thank you and the President for putting in place an industrial policy for the United States. This is one piece of it. There are a couple of other elements out there I want to bring to your attention with regard to Buy America. Now, Chairman DeFazio, when he was here, and Senator Cor- nyn, and I, and others brought to the attention of all of us that the China Railway Construction Corporation and BYD were finding a way of bringing into the United States Chinese rolling stock from Chinese Government-controlled companies.

I urge you to watch carefully. They are trying to get around that in many different ways. Finally, the application of all of this to airports. Waivers may apply to the airports. Watch carefully. The policy of the President was to make it in America, buy America. You and I and others will work diligently to see that that happens. Thank you. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Thank you. You have my commitment to work with you on that. Mr. GARAMENDI. Thank you. I yield back. Ms. MALOY [presiding]. The gentleman yields. Mr. Babin is recog- nized for 5 minutes for questioning. Dr. BABIN. Thank you very much. Thank you for coming to the Hill today, Mr. Secretary. In 2023, the State of Texas received less than 2 percent of all DOT Federal grant awards, despite having contributed over 10 per- cent of the funding to the Highway Trust Fund. Is the Department of Transportation making any attempts to be more equitable in their distribution of Federal grants across the States? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Thank you, Congressman. We pay close at- tention to the importance of geographic distribution as one of the considerations in our competitive programs. Of course, each pro- gram has its own criteria. Project proposals are evaluated based on how they score against their criteria. Certainly, a number of some of the most compelling projects that we have been able to support have been in Texas. We recently were able to award $25 million to the Port of Houston Authority, for ex- ample, out of our reduction of truck emission at port facilities pro- gram. This is over and above the formula dollars. But one other commitment we have is if a project comes in, they don’t quite make the cut because it is an extremely competitive round, we will work with that project sponsor to help them—— Dr. BABIN [interposing]. Excellent. Secretary BUTTIGIEG [continuing]. Put their best foot forward coming around next time. Dr. BABIN. Thank you. Why did DOT release Notices of Funding Opportunity, or NOFOs, for Federal grants such as Mega, Rural, and INFRA for fiscal year 2025 and fiscal year 2026, while we are still in fiscal year 2024? And should not these grants be awarded in their respective fiscal years, rather than potentially circumventing a new administration? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. The short answer is in order to cut redtape. While there are some programs that are administered on such a routine basis that it makes sense to have an annual process and run it again every year, we think in other cases, by folding in ei- ther multiple programs, multiple fiscal years, or both, in the same way that a common application for college means you don’t have to fill your zip code in seven different times, we can reduce the amount of bureaucracy for project sponsors and the amount of proc- essing work for our own team as we are working through that.

Secretary BUTTIGIEG. This is a topic that I am very focused on right now. Both in recent years and in the prior administration, it was not always considered unusual for it to take more than a year to get from an award announcement to a grant agreement. We think compressing that amount of time is part of what it will take to deliver projects more quickly. Part of the challenge, of course, is that a grant agreement can only certify that a project meets Federal requirements if it is actu- ally true. But I want to make sure we take some responsibility for a project sponsor working through that process, rather than just folding our arms and saying, we are not going to sign off until you do everything on your own. Dr. BABIN. OK. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. So, I can assure you we talk about this just about every week, and are taking a number of steps that we think will help compress that process. Dr. BABIN. International freight movement continues to increase at incredible rates. And in Texas, our State agencies, including the Texas Department of Transportation and our Department of Public Safety, are working with the autonomous vehicle industry to make border crossings seamless, effective, and efficient, while ensuring illegals are not coming across the border. What national support and funding enhancements, specifically to the border region, will be proposed to accommodate the increase in freight coming from Mexico into the United States and passing through to Canada? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Well, as you note, there is a strong and swiftly growing demand and flow of goods across that border, and it is going to be more important than ever to make sure it is safe and secure, and at the same time, that it flows efficiently. Several of our grant awards have gone to modernizing land ports of entry in ways that we think will help them efficiently do so. And our Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration is very focused on making sure that inspection capacities keep with the times. We would certainly welcome an opportunity to work with Con- gress on any authorities or resources that might help us take ad- vantage of those new technologies. Dr. BABIN. All right, and one last, final question. Perhaps you read the editorial in last weekend’s Wall Street Journal entitled, ‘‘Biden’s LNG Export Pause Hits Ukraine.’’ And I have a copy of it here, which I would like to enter into the record, Madam Chair- man, that decried the Biden administration’s decision to block LNG exports to our allies. This article, specifying Ukraine—and this would—seemingly plays right into the hands of Vladimir Putin.

Brian Babin BIDEN’S LNG EXPORT PAUSE HITS UKRAINE Kyiv’s Deal With a Major U.S. Supplier Faces a White House Obstacle by the Editorial Board Wall Street Journal, June 21, 2024 https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukraine-dtek-lng-deal-biden-administration-russia-en- ergy-e93c0f23?st=ogsoax16a9sujee&reflink=desktopwebsharelpermalink Good news: Ukraine last week struck a major deal with a U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) supplier to help wean Eastern Europe off Russian natural gas. The bad news: Standing in the way of the deal’s success is President Biden. Europe has diversified its energy supply since Russia’s Ukraine invasion, notably by importing more LNG from the U.S. But many countries still depend on Russian gas that travels through a pipeline that crosses Ukraine. A five-year transit agree- ment with Russia’s Gazprom expires at the end of this year, and Ukraine doesn’t intend to renew it. The agreement’s expiration has hastened the imperative for the region to procure alternative supply. That’s why Ukraine’s largest private energy company, DTEK, last week signed a deal with Virginia-based Venture Global. DTEK would buy LNG from Venture Global’s Plaquemines facility ‘‘to support near to medium term energy security needs for Ukraine and the broader Eastern European region.’’ Under the deal, DTEK will also be able to purchase up to two million tonnes of gas each year—enough to heat about 28 million homes for one month—from the company’s CP2 facility that is underway. Yet there’s a big hitch: CP2 is ensnared in the Administration’s moratorium on new LNG export projects, which could con- tinue if Mr. Biden wins re-election. In January Mr. Biden surrendered to an army of TikTokers by halting permits for new LNG export projects, supposedly while the Energy Department studies their environmental impact. DOE must approve permits to export LNG to countries with which the U.S. doesn’t have free-trade agreements to ensure they are in the ‘‘public interest.’’ This includes Europe and Ukraine. You’d think the Administration would greenlight any project that helps Europe and the rest of the world break their dependence on Russian energy. Russia still accounts for about 15% of Europe’s gas supply. Last month Europe imported more gas from Russia than the U.S. for the first time in nearly two years amid problems at a U.S. LNG facility. If Europeans can’t get gas from the U.S., they will have to turn to Russia. The same goes for other countries. CP2 could supply about 5% of the world’s LNG by 2026. It already has contracts with Germany and Japan in addition to eastern Eu- rope. Yet climate activists have made stopping LNG exports a cause celebre. CP2 is their new Keystone XL pipeline. Biden officials have told allies not to worry, and that the Administration’s permit- ting pause won’t have an immediate impact on U.S. LNG exports. But worry is ap- propriate. The moratorium has caused enormous political uncertainty about the fu- ture supply of U.S. gas. If Mr. Biden wins re-election, will he spurn his progressive supporters by approving CP2 and other LNG projects? Our guess is he’ll make the moratorium permanent. Mr. Biden presents himself as a more reliable ally than Donald Trump. But his LNG embargo shows that his overriding loyalty is to the climate lobby. Dr. BABIN. Secretary Buttigieg, you have a responsibility in your Department for the Deepwater Port Act, which would improve our Nation’s ability to export energy products around the world. How- ever, I understand that your Department is not implementing the statutory deadlines and notices imposed by last year’s NDAA, and is not having regular or any in-person meetings with applicants so they can possibly understand the agency’s concern. I have heard so much runaround, and I would just like to know what the truth is, if you can.

I could assure you our Maritime Adminis- tration team works diligently on applications that come through. They are not subject to the restrictions that were cited in that arti- cle that are more on the Department of Energy side. We would be happy to provide you an update on the status of some of the pending applications. Dr. BABIN. That would be great, thank you. And I yield back, out of time. Ms. MALOY. The gentleman yields. Ms. Titus is recognized for 5 minutes for questions. Ms. TITUS. Thank you very much. Mr. Secretary, it is nice to see you again. And thank you for your patience and waiting for us to come back to vote. It was great to have you in District 1 as we announced the speed train to Cali- fornia. That is going to create a lot of good union jobs, and it is going to be funded right out of that Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. So, thank you for working with us on that. You have heard from many of my colleagues—and I agree with them—that Boeing’s safety track record is a problem. In fact, I saw a cartoon in the paper the other day that said that the airlines were giving extra mileage points if you would sit in the exit row and hold the door on during the flight. That is not the image that we want to project, because we have always been the leader in safety. But another safety issue that I wish you would address is the number of air traffic controllers. I have heard you say that it is a problem, we have a real shortage, there is a hiring target of 2,000 in the fiscal year 2025. I worked with Mr. Yakym on an amend- ment to the FAA bill to do maximum hiring through the FAA Acad- emy. Could you talk about those deadlines, and if there is anything we need to do to help the Academy with resources or changes that will help us to try to catch up to this shortage? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Thank you for your attention to this issue. We share that concern. Over many, many years, the number of air traffic controllers qualified and working has gone down. The good news is that has finally stabilized and begun to go up a little bit. But the problem is, we need it to go up much more quickly. In order to do that, we have requested, as you mentioned, funding to hire 2,000 in the coming fiscal year. We would welcome your support for that fund- ing. We have also worked to increase what we call the force multi- plier of CTI, Collegiate Training Initiative, that can work along- side—never at the expense of, but alongside—our excellent facility in Oklahoma City to help get more controllers qualified quickly. And I am certainly eager to continue working with you both to im- plement all the provisions of the FAA reauthorization and just to make sure that the funding and the recruiting stays on pace. Ms. TITUS. I was going to ask you about the recruiting. How have you beefed that up? Where do you recruit? Whom do you recruit? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. So, we get a remarkable number of appli- cants every time we open a cycle, and we are encouraging people from all walks of life to consider a career that can be rewarding VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00040 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6633 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN31 and lucrative. It is very rigorous, though, and not everybody who comes through the door even makes it through the first few steps. Of course, that rigor is a good thing, and I should assure you none of the measures we are taking involve reducing that high bar of qualification. But we do want to make sure we support those ap- plicants and help them meet those high bars so that they can have a great career, and we can have the numbers we need in our air traffic control workforce. Ms. TITUS. Well, thank you for that. If I can shift gears a little bit to the drone industry, domestic drone industry and the rule- making that has occurred in the past for the line of sight issue, you had 90 experts who submitted a report saying we need to do this, and they made some recommendations to the FAA. A rule was put forward. I worked with Mr. Graves, who chaired the Aviation Sub- committee, hoping to get something by September. Can you tell us kind of how that process is going? Will you meet the deadline? Are there any problems we need to address? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. We certainly understand the importance of that rulemaking. There is complexity in this, the novelty of this issue. We also see the growth of these drones, and we know there is going to be more and more of them entering the national air- space. So, I know the team is hard at work at that. I will try to get you more of—— Ms. TITUS [interposing]. Thank you. Secretary BUTTIGIEG [continuing]. An update, and we are con- scious of the reauthorization provision creating a timeframe for that work to get completed. Ms. TITUS. I just don’t want to see us fall further and further be- hind other places: Europe, Australia. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Understood. Ms. TITUS. Well, thank you. If you will let me know, I appreciate it. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Will do. Thank you. Ms. TITUS. Thank you. Ms. MALOY. The gentlewoman yields back. Mr. Graves is recog- nized for 5 minutes for questioning. Mr. GRAVES OF LOUISIANA. Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Secretary, thank you for being here. It is nice to see you again. I want to raise three things with you. Number one, an issue you and I have talked about both at hear- ings and otherwise, just concerns about the impact of the IIJA when considering things like inflation, supply chain, and construc- tion costs. As a matter of fact, an analysis by the Federal Highway Administration shows that for when the Biden administration came in until now, we have seen about a 69-percent increase in the cost of construction. And at home, that is on the lower end of what we have seen. We have seen projects come in substantially higher. I think when you add in the regulatory agenda of the administra- tion, you are seeing delays. And as you know, the burn rate of the IIJA dollars is not really appropriate. It is not as fast as I know you would like to see it. It is not as fast as I would like to see it. And I think the regulatory agenda, by heaping all of these new reg- ulations, particularly in an environmental space, is slowing things down.

He said, ‘‘We are slated to receive $6 billion from that act,’’ meaning the IIJA, ‘‘over 5 years for tradi- tional infrastructure-related surface transportation, and that is going to be very helpful. But we also have to manage expectations. Of that $6 billion, $5 billion we were going to get anyway. So, the additional funding is about $200 million a year. Again, that is very helpful. But there are a lot of people who think that the $6 billion is on top of the base funding. It is not. And in exchange for the $200 million we are going to get each year, our match obligation is going to be going up by about $50 million.’’ And so, again, the Governor of Louisiana, former Governor of Louisiana, was saying $200 million a year. You have an inflation rate, again, adding 69 percent in there. You do the math, that means that Louisiana is actually getting behind, not getting ahead in terms of the legislation, which I know is not an objective that you or I would like to see. Secondly, I have raised with you a number of times the criteria that we have concerns with, where you came in and unilaterally, without statutory action, said that in all of your grants, you are going to consider climate change, racial equity, environmental jus- tice, and enhancing union opportunities, criteria that I have con- cerns with because of the lack of metrics or specificity. And so, translating that into impacts on the State that I rep- resent, Louisiana, according to an analysis by Politico, we are one of the fifth worst States per capita—one of the fifth worst States per capita—in terms of receiving funding under the legislation, con- cerning because a bridge program that former Congressman Sean Patrick Maloney and I wrote is in there that we thought was actu- ally going to help our State; concerning because some of the PRO- TECT Act programs that we also were involved in drafting are in there, Louisiana got zero—zero—out of that one, which is designed for adaptation and resiliency. So, I am very, very concerned about what I tell people in Lou- isiana when folks look at IIJA and expecting it to be positive, whenever the inflation rate results in it actually not being helpful, the regulations are making it difficult to actually execute—which I know aren’t all your issue, other agencies are giving you environ- mental obligations—and then, at the end of the day, when our home State is one of the fifth worst performers in the country in terms of a per capita receipt, it is very, very concerning. Then the last thing, if—in the 90 seconds I am giving you, if you could, just give us a little bit of advice on your thoughts on how we address this growing deficiency in the Highway Trust Fund, with the user fee being a static 1993 figure. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. I will do my best to cover that in a short amount of time. I will start with a point of agreement, which is I think the environment we have with cost escalation just increases the pressure to get projects delivered quickly, get grant agreements signed quickly, and really improve on the pace that, I should note, is a pace that we inherited, where it is just considered typical to take a year or two. Now, sometimes a project isn’t ready to go, but we want to help them get ready to go.

I certainly want to work with project sponsors in Louisiana to build on the successes that have happened with Lake Charles, I– 10, Lake Calcasieu, the natural gas distribution infrastructure, $10 million that came to your district, and the areas where they have been—some ferries and other areas where Louisiana has been suc- cessful. We want every State to succeed as much as possible in get- ting those projects done that might not have happened otherwise. I won’t claim to have a magic solution on the Highway Trust Fund, but I join you in being concerned about it. I think by the time of the 2026 vote on a future—or potential vote on a future re- authorization, that question will really come to a head, and Con- gress will need to decide whether the user pays principle is the fu- ture, or whether to continue turning to other sources of funding to fund our roads. Mr. GRAVES OF LOUISIANA. Before I yield back, I just want to commend you. I saw your 3-mile time on the race that you did re- cently. It looks like your running is getting a good bit better, and I just want to congratulate you. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. I appreciate you. I was huffing and puffing there, but we made it. Ms. MALOY. The gentleman yields back. Mr. Carbajal is recog- nized for 5 minutes. Mr. CARBAJAL. Thank you, Madam Chair. Secretary Buttigieg, I understand that the U.S. Department of Transportation has announced that $520 million is available for cycle 1 Charging and Fueling Infrastructure, CFI. This is for appli- cations that are highly recommended or recommended. In my district on the central coast of California, the Santa Bar- bara County Association of Governments is spearheading a $20 million grant application that would fund the installation of 21 di- rect-current DC fast-charging stations along the U.S. 101. SBCAG’s application has been listed as recommended. When should appli- cants start hearing from your Department regarding the outcome of their applications? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Thank you for the question. We are hard at work on the CFI program, which is a companion to the NEVI program. Already, 47 awards have been made, amounting to $623 million. And, of course, future rounds will bring future awards. We would be happy to get more information to your office about a timeline. I know that we had our latest Notice of Funding Oppor- tunity out on May 30. Part of what we are trying to do with those rolling applications is to get quicker answers to our project spon- sors, because we know how important these facilities, especially those DCFC—DC fast-charging—facilities that are challenging sometimes for the private sector to do on their own. We know how important those are to communities like those that you serve. Mr. CARBAJAL. Thank you.

For decades, the Federal Government has required commercial service airports to use flourine firefighting foams that contain PFAS. The recently passed FAA reauthorization bill includes a provision that I helped write for a new grant pro- gram that gives airports $350 million over the next 5 years to as- sist in their transition from aqueous film-forming foam, AFFF, to fluorine-free foam, F3, or foams that don’t contain PFAS. What is the FAA doing now to help airports in their transition to these new foams? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Well, thank you for your attention to this issue. We know this is not just an environmental and safety con- cern, but also an economic concern for airports. FAA has done a lot of technical work, found that performance standard in partnership with DoD, that does not require the use of PFAS. And now that that new standard has been put forward, there is a transition plan—an aircraft firefighting foam transition plan—published roughly a year ago with stakeholders from the DoD to firefighters to environmental groups. We will continue to work closely with our airport partners, help- ing them identify best practices, helping them prepare for this transition and, to the extent resources are an issue for them, wel- come further opportunities to work with you on making sure they have what they need. Mr. CARBAJAL. Thank you. Last year, OMB finally, after 2 years of uncertainty, clarified the Buy America provisions established in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that did not apply to construc- tion materials such as aggregate and asphalt binder. This would have put significant restrictions on supply chains for aggregate and asphalt binder. Will the administration continue to pursue new Buy America provisions? And if so, does the administration plan to allow for waivers on manufactured products? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. We are continuing to work to try to ensure that project delivery is kept swift and affordable while meeting our Buy America commitments. The new guidance, we hope, is helpful to our project sponsors, but we know that sometimes it needs inter- pretation, and we want to make sure that we provide further guid- ance as needed. The Federal Highway, FAA, FTA, and FRA rules for iron and steel manufactured products have not changed, but we continue to be ready to work on whether it is waivers or policy guidance to help make sure our project sponsors understand what is required. Mr. CARBAJAL. Thank you. Mr. Secretary, one of the FAA’s most successful and cost-effective Government-industry partnerships for taxpayers is the FAA Contract Tower Program. There are 264 air- ports in the program, including the SLO County Airport in my dis- trict. This critical air traffic safety program supports general avia- tion operations, DoD flight training operations and military readi- ness, commercial air service, and flight schools across the country. What assurances can you give us that contract towers will remain a high priority for DOT and FAA? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. These are certainly an important part of our National Aviation System. There is currently a total of 263 con- tract towers in the program.

It includes measures to try to cover the cost of growth that has taken place. Vendor contract prices have escalated about 22 percent from 2020 to December last year. We are continuing to work to help them keep up. Mr. CARBAJAL. Thank you very much. I yield back. Ms. MALOY. The gentleman yields. Mr. LaMalfa is recognized for 5 minutes for questioning. Mr. LAMALFA. Thank you, Madam Chair. Secretary, thank you for appearing with us here today once again. I appreciate it. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Good morning. Mr. LAMALFA. Let’s see. So, on electric vehicles and the chargers, in the infrastructure bill a while back, there was $71⁄2 billion put forth for that, $5 billion that was allocated to States individually to build their own networks with that seed money. So, the report I have is that since then, we have seen an intense amount of money go out, but we have only accomplished approximately seven charging stations spread amongst four States. So, we have this term ‘‘investment’’ that doesn’t seem to be hitting much of a goal, as people are still frustrated with the—the electric vehicle owners we have still seem to have a lot of challenges finding what they need in order to go more than 30 miles from home, for example. And then the nature of the EV stations themselves are—they are exempted from the Buy America provisions. So, we are buying these components from China and other overseas. So, that is dis- turbing, because we should be building it here when we are, and we would have the ability—which leads to a couple more ques- tions—but Secretary, with—my understanding, there is another $1.3 billion that was added to that initial $7.5 billion. Why are we doubling down on more when the performance so far has been basi- cally only seven stations? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Well, so, to be clear, there are 186,000 pub- lic chargers across the United States. That is about double what it was when President Biden arrived. Most of those have been put in by the private sector, but we believe that public-sector involvement is necessary to build out the rest of the network, hence the NEVI program that you referred to. That program is intended to install tens of thousands of chargers in the second half of this decade, and we have already had 38 of the States that we are providing funding to release their solicita- tions for the program. We are even going to see the first few hun- dred of those chargers installed this year. As you mentioned, there is even a tiny handful that are up and running today. But I want to emphasize our expectations have been that the peak year for in- stallation would be 2027 or 2028, because this is a totally new pro- gram for the States. I do want to emphasize also that this charging program is sub- ject to Build America, Buy America provisions. There is flexibility in that to recognize the fact that we are standing up what is effec- tively a new industry in the United States. But we are committed to making sure that that new American industry is home grown, is creating jobs right here on U.S. soil. And as the States work to- VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00045 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6633 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN36 ward their procurement, we think we are going to really see that demand signal lead to a burgeoning of that industry here in the United States of America. Mr. LAMALFA. The difficulty of the Buy American is that we don’t seem to be able to produce in this country. Well, the mined raw materials have to come from somewhere else, and then the manufacturing pretty much stays in those other areas. And so, we are not doing well at Buy American on what comes from the mines, as well as the finished product, so—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [interrupting]. Well, that is a big part of what we are changing through the President’s initiatives. DOE now estimates with the new awards, for example, for producing a do- mestic battery supply chain, that we will have enough graphite to support 47 percent of the U.S. demand domestically. We are also working on partnerships with friendly countries so that when we do need to turn abroad for materials or refinement, we are not necessarily turning to places like China. And increasingly, recycling will be important because some—— Mr. LAMALFA [interrupting]. Well, let me drill down on that. Secretary BUTTIGIEG [continuing]. Of these materials live indefi- nitely. Mr. LAMALFA. Thank you. Let me drill down on that. Would you be part of a group of voices that would say we need to mine these products in this country, instead of somewhere else? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. I certainly would prefer that they be sourced domestically. Mr. LAMALFA. OK, thank you. On the EVs themselves now, we are seeing that there seems to be a turning around of attitude on that. Like, Ford Motor Company, they lost $41⁄2 billion on them. They are bringing down the price of their electric pickup quite a bit, which—that is probably going to be a loser for them, I don’t know. And they are letting their dealers off the hook from having to install hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of infrastructure to be EV dealerships. So, it is—you see a retraction of that, as well as 7 out of 10 Americans said they do not want to buy an EV because it takes— the charging isn’t there, the battery technology. And then current EV owners, half of them are considering switching back to gas ve- hicles. So, shouldn’t we be tailoring it to people that want them— it seemed like 10 or 15 percent—instead of forcing people up to, you know, a complete ban by 2035 like California is talking? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Well, one of the reasons that we have not forced anyone to purchase any particular vehicle is we want this to be led by consumers making choices, and consumers are choos- ing EVs more every single year than they did the previous year. And I think that reflects the fact that, as the prices come down, more and more Americans decide it is the right answer for them. Mr. LAMALFA. Thank you, Madam Chair. Ms. MALOY.

As we look to fiscal year 2025, I am hopeful that we can build on this progress and continue to make transpor- tation safer, equitable and cleaner. Chicagoland is home to the Nation’s largest rail network. All the Class I railroads, as you know, traverse through Chicago, and my district has countless rail grade crossings, rail yards, and rail workers. As such, rail safety is a huge priority for my constituents. And with the recently released NTSB report on the East Palestine derailment, it is a reminder that we must continue to press this issue. Secretary Buttigieg, I know that rail safety has been a focus for DOT in recent years, but there is yet to be comprehensive rail safe- ty changes at the Federal level. In addition to the recommenda- tions for more inspections, infrastructure improvements, and better emergency plans, what is being done to ensure that rail workers aren’t put in harm’s way? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Thank you for the question. As you noted, this is a central focus for us. We have sought to do everything that we can do, short of an act of Congress, in order to enhance rail safety. Two recent measures I would point to that we think are particu- larly important is our rule on minimum crew size. Most Americans would probably be shocked to discover that, until we acted, there was no rule saying that you had to have more than one person, even on a 2-mile-long train. And the Class I rail corporations seemed to prefer it that way. We thought it was very important to do this. We also recently finalized a rule requiring emergency escape breathing apparatus to be available for traincrews and other em- ployees as they are transporting hazardous materials, and cleared up the information railroads need to provide to community first re- sponders about hazardous materials. But we urgently need legislation from this Chamber and the Sen- ate in order to raise the bar and give us more capabilities. A lot of people in this Chamber had a lot to say about rail safety 11⁄2 years ago, in the wake of East Palestine. I hope that they will end their silence on this topic now, and join you and others in insisting that there be action. Because with the NTSB report now complete, there is really, in my view, no remaining excuse for inaction when we need that legislation. Mr. GARCÍA OF ILLINOIS. Thank you, and I am going to try to do two more questions, so, brevity would be appreciated. How is the FRA encouraging participation in its Confidential Close Call Reporting System? And what can we do to get more rail lines to participate? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. In short, there has been a lot of phone calls, a lot of letters, and a lot of pressure to urge the rails, the Class I railroads, to honor their commitment to join that system. So far, we have brought Norfolk Southern on board with a pilot covering approximately 1,000 of their employees at several sites, and BNSF in April agreed to join, as well, with an agreement cov- ering about 650 of their employees represented by the Dispatchers Association.

Mr. GARCÍA OF ILLINOIS. Thank you. The fiscal cliff that transit agencies are facing nationwide, our local Metropolitan Agency for Planning, also known as CMAP, has developed a visionary plan for action. Transit, as you know, is a fundamental cog that keeps com- munities like mine moving. Cutting service would have dispropor- tionate impacts on those who rely on it. Secretary, what is U.S. DOT—how are you supporting metropoli- tan planning organizations to rethink public transit and commuter rail systems as the funding cliff approaches? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Transit is so important to so many Ameri- cans. It provided 7.1 billion trips in 2023, and we have got to make sure they can stay ahead of these looming fiscal challenges. In addition to engaging MPOs, as you mentioned, I also want to note that the President’s 2025 budget proposes flexibilities that would allow transit agencies to use urbanized area formula funds and flex funds for operating expenses. We think that that flexibility may be helpful for certain agencies as they try to bridge that gap. Mr. GARCÍA OF ILLINOIS. Thank you very much. I yield back, Madam Chair. Ms. MALOY. The gentleman yields. The Chair recognizes Mr. Bost for 5 minutes. Mr. BOST. Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Secretary, with the higher demand of goods and services, many of the industries rely on freight trucks to deliver goods and services to customers. The administration has focused a lot on rail transit and aviation within the budget request, but continues to leave out some important things involving truckdrivers, specifically truck parking. Now, while rail is vital and the rural areas of this Nation rely on the delivery of those trucks, we have also seen an increase in the amount of women that are now driving, thank heaven. While the industry continues to grow, all of these trucks are struggling to find places to rest while trying to abide by the Federal hours- of-service requirements. My legislation, the Truck Parking Safety Improvement Act, ad- dresses a shortfall on the truck parking to allow safe places for our drivers to take a break from the long road without fearing acci- dents, assaults, or robberies. Now, I am asking—and I asked about this topic last year, and was told that the administration was working on the truck park- ing, and I was upset to see the budget request did not include any- thing regarding truck parking. What are you planning to do to ad- dress this issue? Because this issue came out—the first study was in 2002, how bad it is that we need truck parking. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Well, first of all, let me applaud your atten- tion to the issue of truck parking, and make clear that we are ap- plying not just words, but dollars and cents to this issue. We have been able to fund projects in Wyoming, Tennessee, Flor- ida, and other locations to support truckdrivers. So, I can assure you, even if it doesn’t have its own line item, it is something that we consider important for a number of programs like INFRA, and also are urging our State partners to consider this as a use of their VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00048 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6633 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN39 Federal formula dollars, and are encouraging them to remember that they have that flexibility. I spent some time just last week with truckdrivers, including a number of women truckdrivers who we are pleased to see coming into that career. It remains as vital a career as ever. And we have got to make sure that we are supporting the drivers we count on in every way. We are taking a number of measures, including deal- ing with predatory leasing and towing, and encouraging veterans to get their costs paid for training. But I certainly agree with you that parking is probably the num- ber-one issue we hear when we talk to drivers, and we are working on it. Mr. BOST. If we can shift gears on my next question, the Attor- ney General is initiating a rulemaking—I think this was brought up by Representative Crawford earlier in the day—to change mari- juana from a schedule I to a schedule III controlled substance act. As a truckdriver myself that grew up in the trucking business— my brother is still in the trucking business—I know it is difficult to hire and make sure that our drivers are safe. As a matter of fact, it is a real difficult part of hiring right now because of the drug testing. But part of the safety includes knowing the driver could pass that drug test. It is not something that we want to stop. So, I want to ask you about the—I want to—since the—DOJ’s ac- tions will stop marijuana testing of DoD-regulated safety-sensitive employees—now, let me tell you who all this includes—including schoolbus drivers, airline pilots, train engineers, subway and public bus operators, ferry operators, truckdrivers, pipeline operators, FAA air traffic controllers, will you commit to ensure that DOT will continue to test for marijuana, as it currently is permitted to do, even if it moves to a schedule III drug? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Yes, our commitment to that testing con- tinues, regardless of the schedule. And we believe our authorities are intact, too, because they don’t call for testing by reference to where marijuana sits in its classification, but rather it is specifi- cally named. So, whether we are talking about the regulated com- munity, those drivers you were talking about, or whether we are talking about our own personnel, somebody with a security clear- ance or somebody in a tower, our understanding—at this time—is that nothing about that reclassification would change our practices. Mr. BOST. Then here is the problem. Well, just so you know, 1980s is when DOT did the result—and the result of the program, that the accidents were caused by people using marijuana and the problems that occurred. If we don’t stay with that program—and the thing that is dif- ficult about that is, right now, when we have a driver shortage, you can have a beer on Sunday and you are not impaired to drive on Monday. Now, you can smoke a joint on Friday. You may not be impaired, but it is going to show up in that test, and it will show up for 30 days. Something has got to be figured out as far as that’s concerned if we are going to continue down this path, because it makes it very difficult, as a truck owner and a business owner, to find the em- ployees that aren’t spending their time smoking dope in their par- ents’ basement and are more concerned about having a job.

Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Agreed. Mr. BOST. Thank you. I yield back. Ms. MALOY. The gentleman yields. Mr. Pappas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. PAPPAS. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. And Mr. Secretary, welcome back to the committee. I appreciate your thoughtfulness and how much time and how accessible you al- ways are to this committee. So, it is great to have you back. And it is always a good time to talk about how the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is working for our districts. I see that in New Hampshire. We are set to receive about $1.4 billion in State for- mula funds for highways and bridges over 5 years, which rep- resents a significant increase over what we could count on in pre- vious years. And already, about $850 million has been announced for New Hampshire roads, bridges, roadway safety, and other major federally funded projects. So, Secretary Buttigieg, as you know, Federal law allows States like New Hampshire to use toll credits to cover local match require- ments for federally funded projects. But since States could histori- cally only use toll credits for projects within the State where cred- its were accrued, many States left extra toll credits on the table. That is why I have advocated for legislation, the Toll Credit Mar- ketplace Act, provisions of which were included in the Infrastruc- ture Law, which will develop a Federal marketplace for toll credits which will allow States to sell any excess credits to cover the match required for federally funded projects. I think it is a commonsense change. We discussed this last year when you were before our committee. I am wondering if you can update us on any progress with the Toll Credits Exchange Pilot Program that is anticipated to roll out soon. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Thank you. And first let me associate my- self with your enthusiasm for what the Infrastructure Law has brought. And most recently, congratulations to your district on the Rockingham Planning Commission successfully receiving that Sea- coast Greenway Hampton Marsh trail funding. With regard to the Toll Credit Marketplace program, we recog- nize the importance of the value of an innovative program like that that you worked to create. And I know that they are looking to use their toll credits in new ways. I can report to you that the Federal Highway Administration has made a lot of progress on that. As you know, any time you stand up a novel program it leads to a lot of work that goes on in the background, which we are working through. But the focus right now has been developing the right program procedures, including the application and the selection process, making that as transparent and as rigorous as possible. And we will continue to keep you updated on the team working expedi- tiously to get it stood up and ready to use.

I know my State has itself hundreds of millions of dollars of unused toll credits that are on the table, and I know other States are eager to be able to deploy these resources to make the necessary investments that will im- prove roadway safety and improve our economy. Now, my State is at a decided disadvantage when it comes to for- mula funding distribution. And since coming to Congress, I have worked to evaluate current funding structures to ensure States like mine get the adequate support that they need, and that it is dis- tributed in an equitable fashion. The calculations used to come up with the formula are, I believe, grossly outdated. For example, a State like Rhode Island, with half the roadway mileage of my State, received 30 percent more funding in fiscal year 2024. Vermont, which has about half the population of my State, and fewer Federal miles, received nearly 23 percent more in Federal highway funds than New Hampshire did in fiscal year 2024. There are other States that are treated, I believe, in- equitably by the formula, including Texas. I am wondering if you will conduct a study or provide any infor- mation for our committee as we think about the future of highway funding in terms of the formula, and areas where we can look to make it more balanced and equitable for States like mine. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Thank you. We would certainly stand ready to provide any information, data analysis, or technical assist- ance requested as Congress contemplates future changes to the for- mula. As you know, we work to implement the formula as provided by Congress, but certainly hear loud and clear from many States who have found that the formula is not consistent with their expecta- tions, based on their needs, and I am happy to do anything we can to make sure that Congress’ deliberations about that are well in- formed. Mr. PAPPAS. I appreciate that. Drunk and impaired driving traffic deaths have increased by 33 percent in the last 5 years. Even as vehicles are getting safer, crashes, injuries, and fatalities are still on the rise. In the United States, someone is killed or injured in a drunk driving crash every 39 minutes, and an average drunk driver has driven drunk nearly 80 times before their first arrest. Currently, only 24 States and the District of Columbia, including my State, require ignition interlock devices to be installed in the vehicles of first-time offenders. Studies have shown that the use of these interlocks reduce recidivism by up to 70 percent in first-time, repeat, and high-risk offenders. That is why I have introduced leg- islation on this, and I am wondering if you can comment on igni- tion interlock systems and the role that they can play in terms of roadway safety. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. We certainly recognize the promise and the potential of these interlock systems, given, as you noted, the pro- portion of highway fatalities and road injuries and fatalities that are associated with impairment. NHTSA has been working to help research, develop, and test so- lutions, including ignition interlock programs and the driver alco- hol detection system for safety. A lot goes into that and, of course, VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00051 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6633 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN42 we need to make sure that anything that goes out into the field is ready to meet the high bar we are going to set for it. I would note that there was an advance notice of proposed rule- making put out in December to gather more information on tech- nology and research in this regard, and we will be working through that ANPRM and continue to keep you apprized of progress there. Mr. PAPPAS. Thanks. We look forward to more information. I yield back. Ms. MALOY. The gentleman yields. Mr. Johnson is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. JOHNSON OF SOUTH DAKOTA. Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Secretary, of course, there are always going to be a certain number of things you and I disagree on, but I have to start with a compliment. In a town where so many folks, both in my party and your own, seem to peddle fear and anger, some of them almost exclusively, you bring a far more professional and respectful ap- proach to your work. And the communication that I get from you and your team, I think, helps all of us be better. So, thank you with that. As you know, sir, we have a tremendous amount of flooding in my State and surrounding States. It is just devastating to watch people, friends of mine who—their home, everything, all the phys- ical possessions that they own, washed away by these floodwaters. As you know, during disasters, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration has the ability to waive some rules, things like weight limits, hours of service so that impacted communities can get help more quickly. I have got some concerns that a recently fi- nalized rule by FMCSA is going to make it more difficult for Gov- ernors to access those flexibilities. I just wanted to gauge any thoughts you would have on that promulgation. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Let me certainly, first of all, tell you that our heart goes out to those we saw impacted by recent storms in your State, Iowa, and other communities, and would agree that it has been important to have flexibility on things like hours of serv- ice in the context of those disasters. Now that you have raised this, I want to become more familiar with some of the areas of overlap or concern where more recent rulemakings could diminish flexibility on that, because we certainly leaned into that at many moments, notably including the Baltimore bridge collapse, to try to provide some relief. Mr. JOHNSON OF SOUTH DAKOTA. And I think we have got to— and listen, I get it. A lot of these independent and quasi-inde- pendent agencies, it is not like they work for the Cabinet Secretary. It is not like a memo comes out and they salute, and—it is more complicated than that. They need to make their decisions based on an evidentiary record. Clearly, these decisions need to be abiding. They need to go to court and defend them. That is what is so sur- prising about this. I mean, the previous flexibility, the waiver authority for Gov- ernors, allowed them a 30-day period. This is going to shorten it to 14. Keep in mind, the evidentiary record before the administra- tion is that there hasn’t been any particular abuse that they identi- fied, and that there is no evidence that there has been a degrada- tion of public safety because of a 30-day waiver period. And so, to VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00052 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6633 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN43 the extent we should have good decisions based on good data, I am grateful for your commitment to dive in and better understand that situation. Let’s go to permitting. This has been a consistent area of agree- ment that you and I have shared as you have appeared before the committee. I think, in the couple of years you and I have been talk- ing about this, we have made some progress. Let’s be honest, it is modest progress. It is still, as you have talked about in your com- ments in the past, far, far more difficult to get a project sited in this country than it is in most every other developed nation. This is not an area of American excellence. I have had some success in working with my colleagues to ad- vance a digital NEPA review, gotten that language in the aviation bill yesterday, on the water resources bill. I wanted to just touch base with you, sir, and see if your shop has been able to make any progress, particularly in the area of digital NEPA review and proc- essing. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Thank you. I share your sense of urgency and interest here, and I would not challenge your assessment that, while there has been progress, it has been modest. We have taken a number of steps to try to make the NEPA and permitting process more efficient. We have expanded a liaison pro- gram that can provide targeted assistance to project sponsors who would benefit from that. We have been doing more with pro- grammatic agreements so that, if multiple projects have similar characteristics, they can travel together, and we think they can cut some of the redtape that way. Specifically to your question about web-based, digital, or some- times e-NEPA is the term of art, we certainly see a lot of potential here. There is too much literal paperwork in the paperwork. One thing we have done to try to embrace that is a $750,000 Modernizing NEPA Challenge, knowing that some of the best ideas probably won’t come from the building, but will come from around the country. That just launched in April, but we are looking for- ward to seeing the different ideas that come back from project sponsors there. And of course, we are working to maximize the use of categorical exclusions, which just bring a lot less of that process with them. Mr. JOHNSON OF SOUTH DAKOTA. I do think categorical exclu- sions are a ripe area. I mean, we obviously make use of a lot of them, but I think there is so much more ‘‘there’’ there. My closing comment, Mr. Secretary, would be at some point, you are just going to have a brainstorm—and maybe as you drift off to sleep or you are eating your Cheerios in the morning—of an idea that might be a little politically dangerous. It might upset people on your team or on my team, because let’s get it—I mean, we both get it: the siting of large projects in this country is fraught with tremendous emotion and political peril. If you are looking for part- ners to advance your big, dangerous, but important idea, this com- mittee is ready to work with you. Thank you. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. I appreciate that and welcome that.

Thank you, Madam Chair, and I will associate myself with my friend from South Dakota, both in his offer of part- nership and his compliments to your professionalism and respon- siveness in your role. And I also want to say that your work in implementing the Bi- partisan Infrastructure Law has been critical, and I will commend the Biden administration’s efforts to quickly allocate the funds to our communities, as well, for maximum impact. I am seeing the difference in the suburbs of Boston, in the ability of people to con- nect to jobs and services and improve standards of living. As Congress begins to think about the next surface transit reau- thorization, I want to examine what additional tools Congress should be considering to finance transportation projects, and to move away from an Eisenhower-era, car-centric infrastructure sys- tem towards one that is focused on mobility, holistically defined. While the recent reversal of New York’s congestion pricing plan is extremely disappointing, it has nothing to say about the actual policy of congestion pricing itself. Congestion pricing allows cities to accurately reflect the cost of having cars in dense areas. Strong Towns has pointed out that this is not just a reflection of the nega- tive externalities of air pollution, traffic, and emissions, but also al- lows cities to price in the space that vehicles take up. Manhattan has limited space for car traffic, and it should be allowed to reflect that scarcity through tolls, and then use those revenues to fund things like transit and walkability improvements. Mr. Secretary, should Congress consider provisions in the next surface transportation reauthorization that would allow for addi- tional flexibility for communities to price the externalities of driv- ing as they see fit, including through congestion pricing and toll- ing? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. I believe those flexibilities would be wel- comed in communities around the country. As you noted, many of the true costs of the status quo are not reflected in the traditional models that we have. There may be a range of ways to take that on board through different forms, all of which we would like to be able to support to the extent statute allows us to. Mr. AUCHINCLOSS. Would you also encourage us to consider look- ing at the way that we fund highways versus transit, and to say the amount of Federal dollars that are matched for highways, being something like 80 to 20 versus transit at 50 to 50, and excluding operating costs? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. I recognize and respect that a lot of this will probably be hashed out in the coming years as we move toward the next authorization, but I certainly welcome any readiness to have a more holistic approach to pricing both the benefits and the costs associated with developing any mode of transportation, know- ing that we have inherited a model where sometimes, instead of a range of options, people were presented with one option, which was a car. Mr. AUCHINCLOSS. Another way that Congress can finance better transportation operations and capital projects is by restoring em- ployers’ deductibility of transportation fringe benefits. I am pre- paring bipartisan legislation that would make it cheaper and easier for businesses, especially small businesses, to offer transit benefits VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00054 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6633 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN45 to their employees. This will help increase ridership, encourage commuters to shift transportation modes towards public transit and away from cars, and will do so without further subsidizing parking. Mr. Secretary, can you speak to the importance of incentivizing transit use through our tax code and how the private sector can en- courage commuters to use public transit? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Well, to your prior point about externalities, there are so many benefits in terms of safety, conges- tion, affordability when people have an opportunity to use transit. I would also note one of the things that we undertook toward the end of my tenure as mayor of my hometown of South Bend was a pilot covering those costs for employees. And employers reported back to us that the benefits in terms of less absenteeism and over- time from providing that kind of certainty through subsidy for workers’ transportation costs was something that they wanted to double down on. I believe that much of this particular authority rests with Treas- ury, but we would consult with them and certainly be eager to con- sult with you on how to expand access to transportation and transit benefits for employees across the country. Mr. AUCHINCLOSS. Thank you. And I would just note that mak- ing owning a car an option rather than a requirement for younger people is an important way to reduce costs, right? You take a car, and you drive it off the lot, and it loses one-third of its value, and it is really a depreciating asset ever after. Whereas, you take that same amount of money and you can invest it, you can use it to in- vest in yourself. It is a way to build wealth. And at a time when people are really struggling with cost of living, making cars one of many options for them to get around, I think, is an important way to take some of that steam off. And I will yield back. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Thank you. Ms. MALOY. The gentleman yields. Mr. Nehls is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. NEHLS. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. Good to see you, Mr. Secretary. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Good afternoon. Mr. NEHLS. Sixteen months since East Palestine. Obviously, the NTSB report came out the other day. I have been placing close at- tention to it, as I am the chair of the Railroads, Pipelines, and Haz- ardous Materials Subcommittee here, and I believe that she pro- duced a very detailed report. And some of her findings, quite hon- estly, are very disturbing. One of the areas is the post-derailment actions. And when the American people saw this big bloom, this cloud above their city, the decision to vent and burn—and that procedure, according to the re- port, it appeared that Norfolk Southern made that decision. Appar- ently, they were able to—I don’t want to say convince—get the inci- dent commander to agree with that. The report appears that the NTSB said that—and Norfolk Southern compromised the integrity of that decision to vent and burn the tank cars by not commu- nicating expertise and dissenting opinions. The justification, ac- VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00055 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6633 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN46 cording to the report, is polymerization, which is that chemical re- action that could cause the explosion. So, a point is that they said we have to do the vent and burn because we feel this thing could blow up. What are your thoughts on that? How would we—how would incident commanders allow them to do that when we had dissenting opinions? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. One of the most troubling things in that re- port, I agree, was the finding that the vent and—the polymeriza- tion that was feared by those who thought that by undertaking that vent and burn action, they were preventing an explosion might not have actually occurred, meaning that the vent and burn did not have to happen. So, certainly, while that will go to different parts of the decision chain than those that our Department is directly involved with, we want to closely follow how NTSB’s recommendations are taken on board, both in terms of how they apply to a railroad and how they apply to anybody in that incident command. Mr. NEHLS. Sure, and I can understand it was in a rural area, first responders, many of them volunteers driving to incidents in their pickup truck with bunker gear in the back. Maybe the—I don’t want to say the skill set wasn’t there, but they just didn’t— if a derailment like that would have happened in the city of Hous- ton or Boston or someplace, I don’t think you would have burned it. You would have had a massive showing of logistical support with hazmat teams, this and that. But hey, in your testimony, I am concerned about the Railroad Crossing Elimination Program. We know we have about 700-plus deaths a year as it relates to rail. And your testimony says it is improving, or eliminating 400 rail crossings. In IIJA, it is $500 mil- lion. My friend, I don’t think that is enough. We need to do more. I mean, if that is a safety issue, we need to do more. What do you think we should do with that program? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. If you would like to propose growing that program—— Mr. NEHLS [interposing]. I will. Secretary BUTTIGIEG [continuing]. We would love to work with you on it. Mr. NEHLS. I will. Secretary BUTTIGIEG.

We announced it in North Dakota. The enthusiasm—— Mr. NEHLS [interrupting]. We are going to do it. Secretary BUTTIGIEG [continuing]. In communities is extraor- dinary. And I think it has so far been very well received. Mr. NEHLS. How about the AskRail? What do you think about the AskRail? The report says they didn’t know what was in the cars. They didn’t—the first responders didn’t know the chemicals, they didn’t know the consist in the cars. But the actual consist was up in the locomotive, but they didn’t get it for a couple of hours. So, here, these first responders are out there trying to figure out what the hell is in these cars, and they didn’t have it.

I think all Class I’s use it. But we have to do something to make sure that we have the connectivity with cell service in these rural areas, because the AskRail app will be combat ineffective if we don’t have it. One of the colleagues mentioned about the close call reporting system. I support it. I think it is a good idea. How do you think that—quickly, how do you think that will improve safety in our rail industry? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. We think it creates one more opportunity to flag safety issues. We are glad to have a handful of participants but we really believe it ought to be everybody. And—— Mr. NEHLS [interposing]. I agree. Secretary BUTTIGIEG [continuing]. Whether that is done by some kind of requirement through Congress or whether we all just con- tinue pushing the Class I’s, I really hope we can get them—— Mr. NEHLS [interrupting]. Automated track inspection. Obvi- ously, a lot of technology out there. I don’t think a lot of people know about it. How can we—this is the tough sell. How do we get labor and the railroads together on the same page as it relates to these technologies? ATI is a great thing. I mean, it could do a lot. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Yes, I think—— Mr. NEHLS [interrupting]. How do—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [continuing]. I think a lot of the best tech- nologies in the history of our economy have a track record of cre- ating and expanding jobs, even if they change some of the aspects of what those jobs are like. But our posture is that any—— Mr. NEHLS [interposing]. Sure. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. And to be clear, we support and sometimes even ourselves use ATI. We just haven’t seen the data that allows us to be confident that you can remove the human factor. Mr. NEHLS. Sure. One quick thing. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. We think it needs to be alongside—— Mr. NEHLS [interrupting]. Do you support two-man crew? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. We do. Mr. NEHLS. OK, last one, the tank cars, the DOT–111s, the 105s, 117s—I don’t know if anybody understands that, but we want to phase those out, right, the 111s by 2029. I think we can do it quicker. I think we can do it quicker. I would like to move that up, and I will do everything I can to do that. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. That is great news, and one of the provi- sions we are most excited about in the pending bipartisan legisla- tion. Mr. NEHLS. All right. Thank you. Ms. MALOY. The gentleman yields. Mrs. Sykes is recognized for 5 minutes. Mrs. SYKES. Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you, Ranking Member Larsen, for holding this hearing, and, of course, Secretary Buttigieg, for your testimony. I am certainly going to piggyback a little bit off of my colleague and continue to talk about rail safety. As you know, the East Palestine train derailment happened just next door to my district, and we have been very much involved and engaged. Since we have heard from the NTSB, we have penned a letter to this committee, including to Chairman Nehls, to hold a hearing on rail safety. I have signed that letter with my colleague, VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00057 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6633 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN48 Nikema Williams from Georgia, who is also very interested in mak- ing sure that we are holding corporate actors accountable and pro- tecting the safety and security of people across the Nation. And thank you, Mr. Secretary, for your efforts in supporting bi- partisan rail safety provisions in many of the things that we just heard about. I also want to say thank you for visiting Ohio’s 13th District, the best district, of course, in the Nation, as we all say, to highlight some of the local efforts to create workforce development opportuni- ties, expand apprenticeships, and invest in infrastructure to lower costs. And none of these would be possible without the historic leg- islation like the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the implemen- tation work that you have done. We are very grateful for those funds that have made it to our communities, and a lot of people have gotten great jobs, union jobs, especially, that pay well and are safe. But one thing that we didn’t get to do in the district during your visit this week was visit our crown jewel, which we call the Akron- Canton Airport, which is CAK. They have received over $3 million in funding, and this airport was established during World War II, and served as a vital asset for economic development in the com- munity, and generated over $1 billion in the area and over 4,000 jobs. However, even with this type of activity and ridership, passenger rides, it has not protected this airport from threats faced by other small to mid-sized regional airports. So, for example, CAK has seen major airlines consolidate their routes to Cleveland Hopkins, in part because CAK is designated within the Cleveland airport as one market based on the Department of Transportation, and this designation has unfairly excluded CAK from the list of airports that require maximum air service levels, and limits their ability to optimize their role as a key promoter of economic development. And this directly impacts my constituents because these were their jobs that now have moved. So, Mr. Secretary, how can airports like Akron-Canton distin- guish itself as a unique, standalone market when some of the deci- sions by agencies don’t allow them to do so? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Well, first, let me thank you for welcoming us to the district. It was a very informative and inspiring visit. And also let me thank you for your work on rail safety legislation that we are very hopeful gets quick action and results in this Chamber. Having been the mayor of a city that had a small airport that was within driving distance of a big airport but meant a lot to our community, I certainly understand and sympathize with the aspi- rations of Akron-Canton, and want to make sure that airport gets the support that it needs and deserves. I know that we have been in dialogue with the airport about planned upgrades for the air traffic control tower there, but also understand that there is a level of market pressure that is affecting the region. While some of the ways that these radii are set up may be pursu- ant to statute, to the extent there is any flexibility we would wel- come opportunities to work with you on that so that it really makes sense for the region, for the market, and for a community or a facil- ity like Akron-Canton.

We have felt the down- side of the consolidations, and larger airlines, going way back to US Air, American Airlines, when we had Northwest, Delta, even with full flights, loyal customers, and large populations based close to our airport and really a segment of our rural communities really preferring this route, it has been very, very impactful. And so, again, we just want to work with you on that very spe- cific need in our community. We do not want to see this airport go away. It would negatively impact not just northeast Ohio, my dis- trict, but the entire eastern region of the State that certainly needs a lot of love. But with that, Mr. Secretary, I promised you when you were in the district that we were going to be very positive and give you good vibes, because I do know that this can be tough, sitting in meetings for several hours. And I am going to yield back my final 13 seconds so you can take a breath. Thank you, Mr. Chair, I yield back. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Thank you, Representative. Ms. MALOY. The gentlewoman yields. Mr. Mann is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. MANN. Thank you, Madam Chair. And Mr. Secretary, thank you for being here again today. I rep- resent 60 primarily rural counties in central-western Kansas, a lit- tle bit of eastern, as well. In Kansas, we know full well that it is imperative that our highways and roads are drivable, that commer- cial and cargo aviation are able to efficiently operate, and that our railroads are able to deliver goods and provide the transportation that we all need. A handful of questions, Mr. Secretary. America, as you know, we have 5,000 commercial-grade airports, but only 500 of these airports are currently served by commercial services. Around the country, we have seen a steady decline in air services, with more than 150 communities losing air service in the last 20 years. In rural Kansas, this issue is all too real. FAA Ad- ministrator Whitaker has emphasized the need for regional aircraft with a capacity between 9 and 50 seats to better serve these small- er communities, and mentioned plans to prioritize manufacturing efforts for such aircraft. How do you envision new-generation regional aircraft helping to restore regional air service? And what plans does DOT have to accelerate the production of smaller regional aircraft in the country? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Well, thanks for the question, and I cer- tainly can relate to the perspective of a community served by a small airport, wondering whether there is a future for commercial air service there. And part of what I think is compelling about the FAA’s most re- cent work is how it might be able to open up new opportunities in that kind of sandwiched category between one size of aircraft and the next that is a step up. Of course, our primary imperative has to do with safety. That will guide everything that the FAA does. But we also want to make sure we are paying attention to the eco- nomic dimensions of that, to the extent that we are permitted to do that through some of the authorities that we have on the OST of the house.

But we also see there is much more need than has been supported by the resources that we have. Mr. MANN. And we got to keep delivering aircraft in the certain size that is going to make these smaller airports continue to be via- ble, as I see it. The next question, Mr. Secretary, in my mind, it’s imperative that we maintain our Nation’s highways and roads so our econo- mies and supply chains can thrive. I think we all agree on that. As has been mentioned earlier today, electric batteries are far heavier than car batteries. And no doubt these heavier vehicles are going to lead to more wear and tear on our roads quicker than gas- powered cars. Has the DOT considered how its electric vehicle mandates might impact our roads, or offered any thoughts on how these vehicles will pay their fair share when it comes to contributing to the High- way Trust Fund? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Well, if the DOT were ever to contemplate an electric vehicle mandate, we would do so. Since we have not, I wouldn’t phrase it that way. But that is not to take away from the fact that we are conscious of the fact that the increasing use of EVs comes with increasingly heavy vehicles. By the way, so has consumer choice evolving more toward SUVs and trucks, relative to what you would have seen 10, 20, 30 years ago, whether we are talking about combustion or EVs. And this brings me to one of my favorite, though admittedly unfashionable, topics, which is pavement durability. I would encourage you to, if you get the opportunity, to visit our Turner-Fairbank facility operated by the Federal Highway Admin- istration not too far from where we are sitting here. And I was able to see a test bed we have there, where there are 12 seemingly iden- tical strips of asphalt next to each other. But if you dig beneath the surface, literally, what you would find is different makeup, dif- ferent composite, different stacking, and about 300 sensors that are helping beam real-time information about how they weather the different conditions they are subject to. In terms of the other side of your question about funding, we are conscious that as we move toward an increasingly electric future, the gas tax model will not be sufficient to capture the principle of user pays, nor has it been sufficient for some time just to keep pace with demand. I think by the time of the next reauthorization, Congress and the country really will face a choice about whether to remain com- mitted to the user pays principle, in which case there will have to be some revenue source that can equitably collect from EVs the same way that, if you have a gas car, you are paying a gas tax, or be willing to set aside that principle, which in a way is hap- pening de facto with the portion of the Highway Trust Fund that is being gapped with general fund dollars coming from Congress. But I don’t think that is a considered decision. I think it is just a measure Congress has had to undertake in order to make ends meet.

I yield back the balance of my time. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Ms. MALOY. The gentleman yields back. Ms. Scholten is recog- nized for 5 minutes. Ms. SCHOLTEN. Thank you so much, Madam Chair. Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for taking the time to be here today. This must be the regional air service portion of the hearing. So, the Department of Transportation’s EAS program, of course, plays such a vital role in ensuring communities have access to air travel provided by certified air carriers. I am fortunate to have two great airports in my district. The one I want to ask about today is Muskegon County Airport, MKG. Their EAS provider has not met the needs of the community with documented poor operational reliability, widespread concerns regarding the customer experience, and failure to meet the terms of its contract. To quantify this poor performance, MKG—their cur- rent EAS provider’s actual completion rate sits below 70 percent; 68 percent of those completed flights were delayed significantly. Due to a lack of confidence across Muskegon, at the end of 2023, MKG requested a change in its EAS provider, which I fully sup- port. Despite the Muskegon County commissioners and my support for a new EAS provider, as well as a nonobjection letter from the current provider, the Department has yet to complete its contract to ensure that folks can access reliable, quality flights in and out of this vital part of the lakeshore. Does the Department’s EAS and Domestic Analysis Division have the resources that it needs to address these contract changes? We obviously can’t do it without the Department’s sign-off. If not, can you speak to where these delays might be coming in? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Well, thank you. I know that we have a small and hard-working team seeking to keep up with the demand for processing of all of these EAS applications and developments. So, I will commit to learning more about the Muskegon application and anything that can be done to move it along. As far as resources, we, again, have a small but mighty team. They do a great job with the resources that they have, but we would welcome opportunities not just in terms of the administra- tive side, but just more generally, to make sure that EAS is robust so that it can meet the needs of these smaller communities that need and deserve good commercial air service. Ms. SCHOLTEN. Thank you. I appreciate your attention to that matter. On to my next question. We are both proud Michiganders now, and we know that Michigan put the world on wheels, and we are going to keep it moving forward. A big way in which we do that is through the trucking industry. Close to one-quarter of a million jobs in Michigan are—the trucking industry supports one-quarter of a million jobs, and 1 out of every 15 jobs is considered a trucking job in the State of Michigan. These individuals work long hours, risk their safety to ensure supply chains run smoothly. Unfortunately, an ongoing shortage of safe and accessible truck parking throughout the country threatens the safety of all drivers. I know we touched on this earlier in the hearing, as well. It is in- VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00061 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6633 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN52 cumbent on us here in Congress to fix this, which is why I am such a proud cosponsor of my colleague Mr. Bost’s Truck Parking Safety Improvement Act, which advanced out of committee this past year. Mr. Secretary, I understand that while some IIJA dollars were directed towards truck parking funds, these funds were not specifi- cally dedicated for that use, leaving State transportation depart- ments to choose between pursuing truck parking and critical infra- structure projects. Given these pressing needs, how is the Depart- ment planning to address this gap and provide the necessary re- sources to keep truckers and everyday drivers safe? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Well, let me first applaud your attention to the issue of truck parking. It is, far and away, the number-one thing we hear whenever I am with drivers and trucking organiza- tions. As you noted, we have a number of projects going on across the country, but none of them come from a program or a fund that is dedicated for that purpose. So, whether it is a scenario like you de- scribed, where a State is making tough choices about what to prioritize, or our own discretionary grantmaking processes, where I am very keen to make sure we support truck parking, but that is competing with every other worthy cause coming in, it would be different if there were specific, dedicated funding for that. And we would welcome working with you on that bipartisan legislation to make sure that there are more resources than before going to this clear and mounting need, which, by the way, is not just a conven- ience issue for drivers, but really a safety issue for everybody. Ms. SCHOLTEN. It absolutely is for the drivers and pedestrians, the truckdrivers themselves, others who encounter them. We will absolutely continue doing everything we can in Congress to allocate that funding. But of course, the Department of Transportation has the ability to specifically designate that, as well, and I just want to thank you for your attention there. I yield back. Ms. MALOY. The gentlelady yields back, and the gentleman from the great State of Utah, Mr. Owens, is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. OWENS. Thank you. Thank you so much. And Mr. Secretary, thanks for being here. I am going to start off with something very Utah-specific, and thank you for the collabora- tion we have right now with the Federal. The State of Utah is the fastest growing State in the Union over the past decade, with over 80 percent of our population along a 100-mile stretch of I–15 between the Wasatch Mountain Range and the Great Salt Lake, Utah now is also preparing to host for the 2034 Winter Olympic Games. With the growth, it is imperative to have a safe, efficient, and reliable public transportation system to maintain the high quality that we now have in this region. Projects like the double tracking of Utah’s FrontRunner com- muter rail systems are key to addressing traffic congestion, air quality, and affordable housing. The double tracking system is pro- jected to double the ridership and double the frequency of trains. The State of Utah has provided over $400 million to this project, and is now seeking a collaborative Federal partnership to complete this critically important regional project.

Can you affirm the administration’s commitment to continuing working with Utah to get the FrontRunner’s strategic double tracking project ap- proved into the engineering phase this year? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Absolutely. FTA has allocated $494 million to date in CIG funding for this. We have worked closely with Utah’s DOT, and we applaud their attention to growing transit needs in, as you mentioned, a very fast-growing area that is really going to require and benefit from those kinds of investments. With every major project, there are challenges to be met. We want to meet those challenges together. And we anticipate an entry into engineering pending, of course, various requirements that have to be met. But we anticipate that in the year ahead, and would love to be able to celebrate this entering into revenue serv- ice. Mr. OWENS. Well, thank you for that. And I will just say this. Utah is the most innovative. We come under budget, we balance our budget. So, continue to use us as an example for the rest of the country. I think we will all be well served. So, thanks so much for that. We will switch topics real quickly. I am concerned whenever Gov- ernment solutions become highlighted more than the free market. And I fear that we are repeating a mistake that we made in the past when we led a worldwide blind eye to man’s inhumanity to man. We are talking about back in the day, when something as simple as the cotton gin was a game changer. Now, before the cot- ton gin, slavery was just not a profitable venture. It was too labor intensive. It could not scale. The cotton gin allowed it to scale un- limited, as long as it had pickers, and those pickers were slaves. It took 72 years and over 600,000 lives to change that trajectory. My concern right now is EVs are dependent on Congo, the cobalt that is produced in these mines. The U.N. has come up with a re- port that over 40,000 children as young as 6 years old are being used in these mines. I will call that slave labor because children do not want to do that on their own. And my concern again is that we are out of sight, out of mind. We allow man’s natural avarice or greed to put in place our goals, as opposed to the—what might be getting to make that happen. So, here is my question: How does the administration justify the use of taxpayers’ subsidy for this type of environment in which so many children are being used for labor? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. In order to save American lives. But to be clear, we do not tolerate child labor or forced labor—— Mr. OWENS [interrupting]. Just real quickly, you said in order to save American lives? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Yes. There is no justification for, of course, for child labor or forced labor. But if you are asking the justifica- tion for our enthusiasm for EVs, it is to save American lives and in order to prevent forced labor or child labor from going into any of our supply chains. Cobalt is one of the 159 products listed by the Department of Labor as an area of concern—— VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00063 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6633 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN54 Mr. OWENS [interrupting]. Mr. Secretary, I need you to just an- swer that question, because I am having a little trouble digesting that. You are saying to build EVs and using child labor is saving American lives? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. No, of course not. Nobody is saying that anything brought into the United States should include forced labor or child labor. This is one of the reasons why we have acted to reduce the extent to which cobalt is included. As a matter of fact, we believe that 80 percent less cobalt is now going into today’s EV batteries, and we are encouraged to see developments that might drive that even lower. But if you want to know why we believe it is important to adopt electric vehicles, part of the reason has to do with the 29,000 Amer- ican—— Mr. OWENS [interrupting]. Could I—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [continuing]. Gas-associated pollution every year—— Mr. OWENS [continuing interruption]. Could I make a real—I am sorry, and I apologize, I ran out of time. I am so sorry for that. I just want to say this. We are now representing what the cotton gin represented back 200 years ago. We are the impetus. We are allow- ing this to be scaled, China and the United States. We need to let the free market work, so innovation come in. We will figure out a much better way of doing it. And Americans will decide whether they want to buy not on subsidy, but based on all the areas, all these factors that factor into developing this industry. With that I yield back. And I am sorry I ran out of time there. Ms. MALOY. The gentleman yields. Mr. Foushee is recognized for 5 minutes—Mrs. Foushee, sorry. Mrs. FOUSHEE. Thank you to the chairman and the ranking member for holding this hearing today. And thank you, Mr. Secretary, for being here. We realize your time is valuable, and I am sure I can speak for my colleagues that we appreciate your appearing before the committee today to speak about the important work that the Department of Transportation is doing across the country. As I brought up in our Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Ma- terials Subcommittee hearing earlier this month, 2023 was a re- markable year for North Carolina passenger rail. Amtrak ridership in the State saw a staggering year-over-year increase of 33.7 per- cent. We received a number of Corridor ID grants to further build out seven different rail corridors throughout the State, and North Carolina’s S-Line project was awarded over $1 billion via the Fed- eral-State Partnership for Intercity Passenger Rail to help us de- sign and build a high-performance passenger rail line connecting North Carolina and Virginia. So, from your vantage point at DOT, can you speak to the ways in which the investments from BIL have spurred the growth and development of passenger rail in regions of the country like the Southeast Corridor, where communities have historically lacked ac- cess to passenger rail as a legitimate transportation alternative? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Well, thank you. I am enthusiastic about the creation of opportunity for passenger rail, and seeing how that has benefited the North Carolina and the Southeast corridor is, I VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00064 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6633 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN55 think, a prime example of how the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is allowing us to transform our Nation’s rail network. Amtrak set a record for ridership last year in North Carolina, surpassed 1 million riders for the first time, which also brings it all the way back and on track to exceed all of the pre-COVID num- bers that we had seen. And as you mentioned, that billion-dollar grant to develop a new passenger rail route between Raleigh and Richmond, we think, is going to bring enormous opportunity. I want to emphasize that we think that is just the beginning of the corridor development we can do both with conventional, and in the future, we think, high-speed rail opportunities—because we don’t see any reason why Americans should have any less access to excellent passenger rail than people living in any other devel- oped country. Mrs. FOUSHEE. And I am sure you are aware passenger and freight railroads have recently begun testing AI-enhanced camera portal technologies for railcar inspections. And while this tech- nology has the potential to increase the effectiveness of inspections and the overall level of safety in our rail system, I am concerned that railroads won’t be utilizing properly trained personnel to re- view the data these AI-enhanced technologies generate. In the rail industry, there are qualified mechanical inspectors whose sole jobs are to make sure railcars are inspected and safe when departing a rail yard. It is imperative that AI-enhanced tech- nology be tested by these inspectors, and that the results of the AI- facilitated inspections be reported to qualified inspectors to ensure that appropriate corrective actions are being taken when safety de- fects in railcars are identified. Can you speak generally about how the Department is reviewing and evaluating new rail technology like this, in light of the DOT’s innovation principles? And more specifically, can you commit to having DOT review the use of this technology in rail yards to ensure that qualified me- chanical inspectors are being appropriately utilized to review the data that is being produced? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Thank you. Yes, we are committed to en- suring we maintain the high standards that our Department en- forces for the expert-led inspection and quality assurance that keeps our railroads safe. There are certainly any number of new technologies that can help with that. We welcome the development of new technologies, but we don’t view that as a replacement for what we now have, given the data that we have seen, nor do we think it represents an excuse to lower our standard when it comes to what we expect of our railroads. So, we will continue to support and evaluate research on dif- ferent forms of technology for things like track inspection and other safety and quality control functions, but there is no substitute for the human expertise that has gone in so many ways toward keep- ing our railroads safe. And we will continue to work with those who have spent their lives on this important domain of rail safety as we look to the future. Mrs. FOUSHEE. Agreed. Thank you. I yield back, Ms. Chairman.

Mr. Yakym is recog- nized for 5 minutes. Mr. YAKYM. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. And Mr. Secretary, it is good to see you again. I want to discuss two IIJA programs, the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure, or NEVI, and the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure, or CFI pro- grams. As you know, NEVI was funded at $51⁄2 billion and CFI at $21⁄2 billion. After 21⁄2 years, it appears that just the ninth NEVI-funded EV charging station was brought online this month in Pennsyl- vania. A few weeks ago, I asked FHWA Administrator Bhatt how many NEVI funding charging stations he expects to have brought online in 2024. He said he expects it to be in the ‘‘hundreds to thousands range’’ brought online this year. Do you agree with his estimate? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Yes. The bulk of the NEVI chargers will be installed in 2027 and 2028, but I have been impressed to see that some of them will actually come online this year, 2024, and a few of them have even already been installed. Mr. YAKYM. So, you do expect hundreds, if not thousands—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [interrupting]. Yes, I think the first—— Mr. YAKYM [continuing]. By the end of this year. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Right. Like I said, 2027, 2028 is when you are going to see most of the installations, but I expect the first few hundred to come online this year. Mr. YAKYM. OK, thank you. Let’s turn our attention to CFI. That $21⁄2 billion program has brought in zero charging stations online in the last 21⁄2 years because the first grants were only an- nounced in January of 2024. Now, I am happy to report that one of those recipients is the Michiana Area Council of Governments, or MACOG, as I know you are familiar with in your old stomping grounds, but I think their experience is perhaps emblematic of why NEVI and CFI have fallen a bit flat on their face out of the blocks, because 5 months after the announcement, MACOG still doesn’t have a fully executed grant agreement, and of course, no work can start until that is in place. Mr. Secretary, of the 47 CFI awards announced in January of 2024, how many grant agreements have been finalized? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. I doubt that it has been possible to do grant agreements on most of them that quickly. It is not typical, especially on a brandnew program, to do them on anything close to a 5-month timeframe. I am impatient to do them, but I just want to make sure nobody moves the goalpost here for a program that we expect will do the bulk of its work in the second half of this dec- ade. Mr. YAKYM. But do you know how many have been completed? Is it zero? Is it five? Is it 10? Is it half—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [interrupting]. I would have to pull that, but I would not expect any of them to be done yet. Mr. YAKYM. OK, I mean, it is a little bit disappointing that you wouldn’t know the answer, because I did give your staff a heads- up that we would be asking that question here.

A most recent report on IIJA RAISE grants shows that only 118 of the 415 grant agreements have been executed, which certainly is at a time of high inflation, and these delays certainly serve to bust budgets and put projects in jeopardy. So, when would you expect all 47 of the original grant agree- ments to be executed? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. We can only certify a grant agreement if it actually meets Federal requirements. So, I can’t guarantee on be- half of any project sponsor when they will be ready. What I can guarantee is that we will work with them to get ready, but we can only certify that something meets Federal law if it is actually true. I also respectfully think you are mistaken to characterize this timing as delayed, especially given that it is the same general time to grant agreement as we saw in the previous administration. That is not to say I don’t want it to be faster, I just want to make sure we are being honest about the—— Mr. YAKYM [interrupting]. What should the target be—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [continuing]. Patterns that we have inher- ited when it comes to how long it takes to get from an award an- nouncement to a grant agreement, especially when we are talking about a novel program. Mr. YAKYM. What do you believe the general target should be for new grant agreements to be put in place? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. So, again, it really depends on what kind of project. For example, if MACOG were to come to us, they said they want to do an interchange, they are hoping to get it to con- struction by 2027, we may recognize that if they are not ready to have the pieces in place for a grant agreement until 2026, that might be workable. Whereas, for another program, where they want to be running in the next construction season, we are going to want them to turn that quickly. But it is extremely rare—and I mean extremely rare—for any project to lapse past the obligation deadline set by Congress. Mr. YAKYM. Thank you. The most recent quarterly NEVI update showed that there are now 183,000 publicly available charging ports. How many of those were built by the Federal Government? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Those were built by the private sector. Mr. YAKYM. Yes, so, there are—so, with those being built by the private sector and the most recent NEVI quarterly report showing that we have got 37 charging ports out of 183,000 built by the Gov- ernment, do you believe that there is still an appropriate role for the Federal Government to play here, given the fact that the pri- vate sector is doing so well in building these charging ports? Shouldn’t the Federal Government pull back and just get out of the business? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. No, we think it is really important to fill in some of the gaps in areas that won’t pencil for the private sector. Look, the vast majority of EV charging takes place at home. But having those public chargers out there is going to be important. And it has been very clear from our research that the private sec- tor alone won’t reach some of the areas, whether we are talking about low-income areas, rural areas that are spread out, they just don’t pencil. That is why Congress created this program, which is designed to create tens of thousands of chargers in the second half VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00067 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6633 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN58 of this decade. But I am pleased to see the very first handful of them already online. Mr. YAKYM. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. And Madam Chair, I yield back. Ms. MALOY. The gentleman yields. Mr. Deluzio is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. DELUZIO. Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Secretary, good to see you here today. I will start with a bit of thanks. I was very excited to hear the Department and you, Mr. Secretary, select Sharpsburg in my district for a competitive RAISE grant, $25 million. I know you heard from me and the Department heard from me on this, a big deal for my region, a big deal for Sharpsburg. So, thank you. Turning to rail safety, which I am sure is no surprise, I have been very encouraged today to hear colleagues on both sides of the aisle express support for rail safety, for some commonsense meas- ures to make freight rail safer to protect communities like mine. I appreciated your and the administration’s strong support of the Railway Safety Act. I was very encouraged to hear subcommittee Chair Nehls express some support there. I look forward to working with him and others to get something done. It has been more than a year since the East Palestine derailment and Norfolk Southern’s train. My constituents, many within the evacuation zone, infected—affected, excuse me—in their homes, farms. Certainly, our neighbors in Ohio bear much of the cost of this, as well. Many are still dealing with the uncertainty around the safety of their air, their soil, their animals, water. We have got the NTSB findings now. I know we have had some discussion here today. Chair Homendy has talked about at length the main cause, of course, being overheated wheel bearing and faulty detectors on the tracks. What shocked me—and we have heard some reports of this be- fore the findings—was Norfolk Southern and its contractors with- holding information from first responders, the incident commander on the ground, specifically information from the manufacturer of the chemicals, who was telling Norfolk Southern and its contrac- tors that, in fact, they were not at risk of explosion, those cars. The cars were more modern, and thus able to withstand what had hap- pened and, in fact, were cooling. That information was not conveyed to the folks on the ground. They were pressured, in my opinion, to authorize the vent and burn, which sent a toxic fireball over the sky of my constituents and our neighbors in Ohio, imperiling their health. I find it unac- ceptable. It didn’t need to happen. And I think the question is, why? It seems to me the railroad wanted to get the trains moving again, putting their profit, their lust for profit above the safety of my constituents. So, I ask a very simple question, Mr. Secretary, to start: Do you trust the railroads to regulate themselves? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Absolutely not. Mr. DELUZIO. Me neither. I think what we saw in this derailment and in conduct thereafter is they cannot be trusted. I think we have a bipartisan path forward.

I think it speaks to a lack of commitment to public safety, a thirst for profit that is unending. And of course, some in Congress have said that, well, we have to wait for the final NTSB findings to act. We have those. I think that excuse is gone. I am—again, I am excited to see that there are folks here in both parties who want to work together to get this done. The Railway Safety Act, as you know, I think may be the only piece of legislation that Joe Biden and Donald Trump agree about. This ought to be an easy thing for this committee to work on. You mentioned two legislative actions specifically from the find- ings, one being caps on fines the railroads pay. Currently, I think it is around $225,000. The Railway Safety Act increases that tre- mendously to 1 percent of railroad’s annual operating income. So, the bill addresses that point. And then another piece, which you have mentioned, I heard Chairman Nehls also expressed support about, increasing or accel- erating the upgrade timeline for tank cars. We have these provi- sions. We can get this done. I would urge my colleagues to support me in doing that. I will give you a chance, Mr. Secretary. Plenty of things you and the Department are doing around rail safety, but you need help from Congress. What else do you need us to do? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. We need this legislation. Look, we are doing everything we can, short of an act of Congress, but we are urgently calling for Congress to act because legislation like the leg- islation you have put forward will give our Department a stronger hand to hold railroads accountable and to keep our railroads safe. We are talking about an extremely—some would say ridicu- lously—profitable industry. They have the means to operate more safely. But unless a law requires it of them, it will not happen. And I believe the provisions that we have talked about like the in- creased fines, acceleration of the adoption of stronger tank cars, as well as measures that would enhance the handling and the flow of information about hazardous materials are going to save lives. And the moment Congress gets that action through this Chamber and the Senate, where, of course, the committee in the Senate has al- ready heard it, we will get to work right away implementing that. Mr. DELUZIO. Very good. We will do our best here, sir. I encour- age my colleagues to join me on this. Madam Chair, I yield back. Ms. MALOY. The gentleman yields. Mr. Kean is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. KEAN OF NEW JERSEY. Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Secretary, it is good to see you. Thank you for being here today. This hearing could not have come at a better time, at least for my constituents in New Jersey. Mr. Secretary, as you know, during this past week, the Northeast Corridor, particularly between New York Penn Station and Newark, saw major delays due to its myr- iad of issues, some related to power challenges, potentially out- VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00069 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6633 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN60 dated infrastructure, and system failures. Not only have these major delays and cancellations become all too regular, but now con- stant, with 16 such incidents within the last 6 weeks alone. Just last week, I wrote to Amtrak CEO Stephen Gardner re- questing information and remedies for recent delays and cancella- tions. Today, I was informed that Amtrak and New Jersey Transit have reached an agreement to investigate these issues, and I am reviewing that agreement now. Additionally, I, along with my colleagues in the New Jersey dele- gation, sent you a letter this week requesting an investigation into the failures along the affected section of the Northeast Corridor. And I hope that my colleagues and I will receive a response soon because these regular delays prevent working parents from attend- ing their children’s sporting events and missing cherished family dinners. I look forward to working with you and your team on fix- ing these important issues. Mr. Secretary, the commuter railroads that operate up and down the Northeast Corridor—New Jersey Transit, Long Island Rail Road, and Metro-North, SEPTA in Philadelphia, and others all have board of directors meetings that are open to the public so that the public can see the decisions that affect them are being made, and so, they can give their input to leaders directly. Still, Amtrak’s board meetings are not open to the public. Mr. Secretary, would you support Amtrak becoming like the other railroads and holding open public meetings? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. I haven’t had a chance to evaluate what ef- fect that would have on Amtrak’s governance. Obviously, they oper- ate by different requirements than a Government entity because of their quasi-government role, but I certainly agree that a high level of transparency is important in how a corporation of that public importance conducts its business. Mr. KEAN OF NEW JERSEY. Could you please investigate that and get back to me directly in writing what your opinions are on that? Because I think it is very important, and I agree with you, the more transparency for everybody involved in this, especially those people who are subject to any decisions of any board of directors needs to be public. Thank you. Increased funding for Amtrak has allowed the agency to hire a significant number of employees in the last few years. How many employees has Amtrak hired for key operational functions such as flagging, track and tie repair, and electric traction repair? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. I am sorry, the question is? Mr. KEAN OF NEW JERSEY. Yes, how many employees has Am- trak hired for key operational functions such as flagging, track and tie repair, and electric traction repair? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. I don’t have a tabulation of hires by em- ployee category handy, but I would be happy to request one from Amtrak on your behalf if you would have trouble getting that. Mr. KEAN OF NEW JERSEY. Thank you. How is U.S. DOT ensur- ing that Amtrak is investing in positions that actually do improve day-to-day operations? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Well, ultimately, it is a question of per- formance, and we want to make sure that Amtrak is meeting the performance marks that are expected of them, whether we are talk- VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00070 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6633 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN61 ing about on-time performance, maintenance issues, or their fiscal condition. We have certainly seen a lot of improvement on the fiscal side, in terms of them moving their operating numbers closer to break even or into the black pre-COVID, and would encourage them to continue that work. But also in very specific ways we fund—mainly on the capital side—their operations in order to make—or their growth in order to make sure they have the equipment they need. I was concerned to see the recent mark from the House cut fund- ing for Amtrak. I think they are working with resources that are sometimes spread thin, but working toward a very important mis- sion. Mr. KEAN OF NEW JERSEY. As you know, I support Amtrak and continued service, and we need to have more stops, as we have dis- cussed in the past, in Trenton, as well as in Metropark and throughout the entire Northeast Corridor in New Jersey. How specifically do you ensure that Amtrak’s internal processes prioritize day-to-day operations from the top down? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Well, it is certainly something that we com- municate in our engagements with Amtrak, the desire for a focus on results for the end user. I know they are balancing a lot of com- peting priorities in terms of their capital needs, operations and maintenance, and their vision for the future. But we know that one of the biggest obstacles to Amtrak’s reliability has been under- investment. And we believe that the historic investment we are making through the President’s infrastructure package is helping them to get ahead of that. Mr. KEAN OF NEW JERSEY. Thank you, I yield back. Ms. MALOY. The gentleman yields. Ms. Norton is recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Secretary, we have recently seen overall traffic fatalities start to decrease, but fatalities of vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and bicyclists continue to rise. Under the In- frastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Congress required States to complete vulnerable road user safety assessments. The law also re- quired States with high rates of pedestrian and bicyclist fatalities to dedicate a portion of their highway safety funds to stopping these needless deaths. What is the Department learning from the implementation of these provisions, and what else is needed to reduce pedestrian and bicyclist fatalities? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Well, thank you for the question. Like you, we have been heartened to see improvements in the overall num- bers of roadway fatalities over the last eight quarters in the U.S., but we continue to see very troubling patterns in terms of pedes- trian and cyclist injuries and fatalities, or vulnerable road users. Part of what we have been able to do about it is through our Safe Streets and Roads for All program to help communities, including those undertaking the assessments you have described, implement plans that better protect vulnerable road users from exposure to traffic. I fear sometimes that media or other accounts of things like bike lanes treat them as ornamental, when they are really about life safety. And whether we are talking about bike lanes, lighting, sign- VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00071 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6633 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN62 age, or other measures, many of the things that we are now able to fund in hundreds of communities across the country are, we be- lieve, contributing toward a safer environment for pedestrians, cy- clists, and other vulnerable road users to go about their commute, their trip, whatever they are doing, without harm. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Secretary, last fall, the Department issued guidance on how two loan programs, TIFIA and RRIF, can be used to support transit-oriented development, including conversions of unused office space to new housing, which is particularly needed in the District of Columbia, which I represent. Has the Department authorized any Federal funds for office conversion projects, and how can we get more funds out the door? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. We have got a number of those in the pipe- line, and our first transit-oriented development loan was closed in April, the Mount Vernon Washington Library Commons project, which is now under construction. We are very hopeful that this program will lead to support for those conversions you were de- scribing. Post-COVID commuting patterns are changed, and the mix of what different cities require in terms of housing versus commercial square footage is different. We want to make sure we are helping them make use of opportunities to do those conversions, knowing the housing crunch that so many communities face. We can’t pre- dict a definite timeline for when some of the other applicants will be ready, but we are working through a number of applications as we speak. We would be happy to keep you apprised of the develop- ment of that new pipeline in the TOD funding. Ms. NORTON. I want to discuss the importance of strengthening consumer protection in transportation. This past April, the Department issued a final rule requiring air- craft carriers to provide automatic refunds when airlines cancel or significantly change their flights. I recently introduced the House- hold Goods Shipping Consumer Protection Act with Representative Ezell to give the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration more authority to protect consumers from fraud in the interstate trans- portation of household goods. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration receives thou- sands of complaints every year from Americans who are victims of fraud in the shipment of household goods, and my bill would grant the agency the authority to reimburse States for enforcing Federal consumer protection laws related to the transportation of house- hold goods, and to assess civil penalties against unregistered ship- pers and against entities that hold consumer personal goods. What other steps is the Department taking to strengthen con- sumer protection in transportation, Mr. Secretary? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. We see how fraud in the movement of goods has created just gut-wrenching stories from people who are vulnerable when somebody else has possession of their goods dur- ing a move. So, FMCSA has increased its efforts to combat external fraud relating to commercial motor vehicle and driver operations. Legislation such as what you have led on introducing, could give FMCSA the explicit authority needed to assess civil penalties for violations of commercial regulations, withhold registration from ap- plicants who have failed to provide the right verification dem- VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00072 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6633 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN63 onstrating that they are legitimate, and allow us to expand our household goods program by engaging States as force multipliers. So, we welcome this, and appreciate your work on it. Ms. NORTON. Thank you, I yield back. Mr. BURLISON [presiding]. Thank you. The Chair now recognizes himself for 5 minutes. Secretary Buttigieg, you have recently—just earlier today, you have answered a lot of questions related to the slow implementa- tion of the EV charging stations. And one of the conversations that you had, I thought, was concerning, and I want to kind of touch upon it, was the statement that this push towards electric vehicles, even though there is a cost of slave labor, and that we are seeing— and it is not just cobalt. We have got lithium and other items that are being supplied by—90 percent of it is coming from China, so, we are empowering someone who is an aggressor to the United States, and yet you are saying that it’s fine, so long as we are sav- ing lives in America. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. That is not an accurate characterization of what I have said. We wish you would have supported us in moving more of this on- shore, so it would be produced in America. But the legislation did pass. And to take graphite alone, we are going to be able to supply, we estimate, 47 percent of it domestically. Nobody believes in allowing any product that doesn’t meet labor standards to be imported to the United States. And if you would like to work with us on making sure any of the 159—— Mr. BURLISON [interrupting]. So, let’s—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [continuing]. Items of concern to include co- balt—— Mr. BURLISON [continuing interruption]. Let’s talk about—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [continuing]. Will be better enforced, we welcome that. Mr. BURLISON [continuing interruption]. Your view that it saves lives. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. We believe that preventing harmful pollu- tion—well, we don’t believe, it is a fact that preventing harmful pollution in the U.S. will save lives. Mr. BURLISON. Have you done any calculations—given the cur- rent rate of fires that occur, and these fires, as reports indicate, take hundreds of thousands of liters of water to extinguish when an electric vehicle catches fire, do you have any research that indi- cates how many people might die from some of these fires? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. I haven’t seen a projection of that. I am sure you are aware that flammable liquids are also a safety con- cern. And either way, we work to make sure that they are handled in a safe fashion. Mr. BURLISON. We are not seeing the reports of vehicles, like an epidemic of regular gasoline vehicles catching fire—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [interrupting]. You’re not? Mr. BURLISON [continuing]. Across the United States. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. You have never heard of gasoline fires in vehicles? Mr. BURLISON. Does it take 150,000 liters of water to put out?

Are you familiar with what happened to the I–95 bridge? Let me assure you that the use of flammable liq- uids to propel hundreds of millions of vehicles includes hazards. Let me also make you aware that the American Chemical Society estimates that 9,700 Americans a year die from the pollution asso- ciated with passenger vehicle use in this country. Mr. BURLISON. Let me ask this question. There have been reports of individuals who have been locked in an electric vehicle. There was a recent story. Renee Sanchez found her 20-month-old grand- daughter stuck in an electric vehicle in the heat. The battery had died, and they couldn’t get the child out. They had to call and get firefighters to come break the glass in order to get the child out. Just recently, last year, Secretary Granholm had an embar- rassing incident where she had a PR tour that went south. It was promoting electric vehicles and that push, driving across the coun- try in electric vehicles. Apparently, she had an advance team that was in a gas-powered vehicle. That advance team occupied the charging station, the one charging station that a family needed, causing that—who had an infant—that family to have to call 911 so that they could make sure that they were able to provide some kind of care for their infant child in that heat. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. I imagine you are aware that the number of publicly available chargers has nearly doubled since we took of- fice, and we are investing to fill in the gaps. Now, 80 percent-plus of charging happens at home, but for the rest of it, that is where those public chargers are so important. Mr. BURLISON. But do you see my point—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [interrupting]. But we have just never been the kind of country that holds on to old technology because we are working on problems with the new technology. Mr. BURLISON. Do you see my point that the American people are seeing what is happening, and they have serious concerns? And yet we are pushing ever more in this direction. And I don’t know that we are actually taking into consideration the human costs that these are also bringing with them: the potential for batteries to die, people to be stranded in places without air conditioning, without support. And I would think that your administration would want to have those facts, as well, how many people might die because of fires oc- curring from these batteries. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. A battery dying is a problem, just like run- ning out of gas is a problem, which is why we are investing in ad- dressing that. I have just never thought of that as an excuse to hang on to dirty and expensive fuels and old technology. Mr. BURLISON. Well, the American people disagree. They do—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [interrupting]. Well, no, the American peo- ple disagree with you because every year—— Mr. BURLISON [continuing]. They are not buying—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [continuing interruption]. They are buying more EVs. Mr. BURLISON. No, the Government is buying—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [interrupting].

Because it was—present the numbers, because every—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [interrupting]. Sure, 1.2 million vehicles were purchased last year, and every single quarter—— Mr. BURLISON [interrupting]. And how many of them were Gov- ernment? Secretary BUTTIGIEG [continuing]. Every—how is that? Mr. BURLISON. How many of them were purchased by the Gov- ernment? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Approximately 0.5 percent. Mr. BURLISON. Of—so, of the number, you are saying that—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [interrupting]. Of the EVs, about 0.5 per- cent were purchased by the Federal Government. Mr. BURLISON. The only reason why people are buying them is because of the subsidy. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Well, the subsidy makes it more affordable and helps people buy them. That is true. Mr. BURLISON. Thank you. My time has expired. I recognize Mr. Johnson from Georgia. Mr. JOHNSON OF GEORGIA. Thank you, Mr. Secretary, great to see you. And you arrive at my doorstep on a high, as far as electric vehicles are concerned. I want you to continue on this streak that you are on right now, explaining why it is important that our econ- omy lead in terms of adopting new forms of clean, renewable en- ergy, automobiles representing a big part of that. I want to open the floor to you to kind of talk about why we are heading in this direction, why it is important that we continue to do so. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. I appreciate the question, and I want to emphasize part of why I care so much about this is that I grew up in northern Indiana, the industrial Midwest, and the home of what had been the Studebaker car company, which went out of business 20 years before I was born, and that meant that I grew up sur- rounded by crumbling and decaying factories that were a con- sequence of our automotive economy and our part of the Midwest not keeping up with the most recent and necessary processes and technologies. So, I know what is at stake, economically, for our country in terms of the importance of us leading the EV market, instead of finding excuses to hold on to dirty and expensive fuels and old technology for as long as humanly possible. I also appreciate the opportunity to return to one of the impor- tant dimensions of the exchange I was just having with Represent- ative Burlison, which is life safety. ACS data suggests that 29,000 deaths per year are attributable to human-caused domestic omis- sions, including 7,700 from truck use and 9,700 from passenger ve- hicle use. We have a chance to change that. And if there is any problem, safety or otherwise, with any new technology, that is not an excuse to stop pursuing new technology, it is an imperative to make sure that that new technology unfolds well, unfolds safely, and that is what our Department has been doing for as long as it has existed. Mr. JOHNSON OF GEORGIA. Yes, our EV technology is world-lead- ing at this point, but it is subject to being overshadowed by what is taking place in other nations. Can you talk about that?

Well, China has invested hugely in its EV capabilities. I don’t believe that is because the Chinese Communist Party is enthusiastic about the environment. I believe it is because they perceive the economic and strategic benefits of trying to domi- nate that market, which is one of the reasons why the Biden ad- ministration is protecting the U.S. market with appropriate tariffs on that unfairly subsidized Chinese industry. We face fierce competition from around the world, just as we did in the first chapter of the automotive industry, but we are deter- mined as an administration—and I am determined as a child of the industrial Midwest—to make sure that America leads the way in the EV revolution, just as we led the way the first time around in the arrival of automobiles a little over 100 years ago. Mr. JOHNSON OF GEORGIA. The Biden administration has been responsible for creating 16 million-plus new jobs during this 31⁄2 years in office. Can you tell us about job growth that is associated with the EV industry? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Well, we have seen EV battery and manu- facturing facilities rise across the country. Of course, in Georgia; in my home State, both my new home State of Michigan that I mar- ried into and my State where I grew up of Indiana, and whether we are talking about the battery side or the manufacturing side, we know that we have got the opportunity to create new, good-pay- ing jobs. Part of what was at stake in the UAW strike and the historic contract that those workers earned was to make sure that that EV economy continues to create not just large numbers of jobs, but good-paying jobs. And that is part of why the President was so proud to be with those auto workers as they sought that great op- portunity. Mr. JOHNSON OF GEORGIA. The first time a President has been on a picket line. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. That is true, yes, sir. Mr. JOHNSON OF GEORGIA. And I will note that the union move- ment has just exploded since the Biden administration came into office. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. It has been an extraordinary time for American workers, historic contracts in many sectors, including, of course, transportation and manufacturing. Mr. JOHNSON OF GEORGIA. Thank you. Let me ask you this ques- tion. The Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority and the Georgia Department of Transportation applied for the Department of Transportation’s Mega grant program for their Georgia 400 Ex- press Lanes project. This project will combine the Georgia Depart- ment of Transportation’s express lanes and dedicated bus rapid transit lanes to significantly improve congestion and transit access to over 120,000 jobs within a mile radius of the 5 stations. Can you discuss the strategic timing and expected outcomes of the Mega grant awarded to support this initiative? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Thank you. We are working through those Mega grant applications through the course of this year. I certainly recognize the enthusiasm around this project, and I can commit to you I will make sure it gets every fair consideration, and I will be- come more familiar with the specific project.

Thank you, I yield back. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Thank you. Ms. MALOY [presiding]. The gentleman yields. Ms. Chavez- DeRemer is recognized for 5 minutes. Mrs. CHAVEZ-DEREMER. Thank you. Mr. Secretary, the last time you were before this committee, we discussed the shortsighted—in my opinion and many others—toll- ing plans in Oregon. Since then, Oregon Governor Tina Kotek, thankfully, has shelved those plans to toll our Oregon commuters. Another flawed tolling plan was also recently suspended in New York City, when Governor Kathy Hochul announced that she would pause the congestion pricing for commuters in Manhattan, a plan that a few of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle on this very committee opposed. Mr. Secretary, do you think the suspension of these tolling plans is indicative of a larger trend? And to follow up with that, the general public seems to me, and I think to many others. they have finally have had enough of pay- ing these exorbitant prices. And as former mayors—and we dis- cussed that earlier—we care about what is happening on the ground in our districts, and that is where we get the feedback. So, can you answer those questions for me? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Well, of course, we take care to respect the role that State and local governments have in making decisions that are in their jurisdiction, and often these tolling calls are among them. I also recognize that States and local jurisdictions face a lot of challenges in funding roads, bridges, other things that are needed. Where we come in is to make sure that any measure that is taken meets any Federal requirements if it is a Federal road, but also that we provide funding to help so that there is the capital in place that—now, I want to be clear, I am not saying it is a sub- stitute for local or State funding. In fact, the more State or local communities ready to step up, often the more we can do in turn. But we do want to make sure we move out of the era that we lived in back when I was mayor, when it sounded like the answer too often from the Federal Government was you are on your own to find a way to fund this project. Mrs. CHAVEZ-DEREMER. OK. So, if—our Governors are con- cerned—I just mentioned two of them—with the pricetags of these large-scale infrastructure projects during the time of high inflation, and we are seeing that today. And so, I think it is a good idea. And with the chairwoman sitting behind me from Utah, we are talking about permitting reform. And Congresswoman Maloy and I have a new bill, the Full Responsibility and Expedited Enforce- ment, or the FREE, Act. This legislation aims to streamline the Federal permitting process by introducing a permit by rule system. Permit by rule is an approach where preset standards are estab- lished for permit issuance, allowing for automatic approval once these standards are met by the applicant. This method reduces wait times, minimizes bureaucratic delays, and focuses on compli- ance enforcement, rather than lengthy initial reviews of the permit application.

Permit by rule can enhance this coordination and lead to more efficient uses of resources and faster completion. Another large infrastructure project my constituents are all too familiar with is the I–5 bridge replacement, which is slated to begin construction in late 2025, but not completed as a project until 2033, 8 years. I can’t help but imagine that if permit by rule were to be implemented to at least some portions of the project, that Or- egonians and Washingtonians would be able to traverse the Colum- bia River much sooner. So, with that said, Mr. Secretary, how are the Federal and State agencies collaborating to ensure a smooth permitting process for bridge reconstruction? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Well, we want to make sure that the per- mitting process is not an obstacle to project delivery—— Mrs. CHAVEZ-DEREMER [interrupting]. But it is. Secretary BUTTIGIEG [continuing]. And we have undertaken a number of measures to help with that. That has included pro- grammatic agreements, so that you can batch projects if they might travel together because they have certain things in common. Just digitizing the NEPA process we find could add a lot of value. We have launched a Modernizing NEPA Challenge, and we are promoting more of those kind of web-based approaches, and we are maximizing the use of categorical exclusions. Now, admittedly, that won’t apply in a project as large and complex as the IBR. We un- derstand that. Mrs. CHAVEZ-DEREMER. But do you think that implementing the permit by rule, which, again, would provide the clear standards, ex- pedite permit issuance, serve as a model for future infrastructure projects to enhance that interagency coordination and reduce those permitting delays, I mean, that seems to be the problem, and it costs money. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Well, I am interested in anything that can reduce unnecessary delays. So, I would welcome a chance to see more about the text of your proposal and how it might be put to work. Mrs. CHAVEZ-DEREMER. OK. Well, a smaller scale project, in- stalling the EV chargers. There was some conversation, but it was recently reported that despite the administration’s commitment to install half a million chargers by 2030, only 8 have been installed since the IIJA was enacted 2 years ago. Mr. Secretary, installing an EV charger can’t be that hard if the funding is already allocated. And if the projects were to receive cat- egorical exclusion designation under NEPA, would permit by rule help alleviate delayed construction of the chargers as well? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Without knowing the particulars of the structure of the program you are describing, it is certainly possible that anything that simplifies environmental processes could lead to a faster project delivery. Mrs. CHAVEZ-DEREMER. Well, I like the world of possibilities, for sure, so, I look forward to working with your office on this, Con- gresswoman Maloy and I, and further discussing the permit by rule on both the small and the large capacities.

Thank you, Mr. Sec- retary. Ms. MALOY. The gentlewoman yields—and thank you for the plug of my bill—and the Chair recognizes Mr. Huffman for 5 minutes. Mr. HUFFMAN. Thank you, Madam Chair. And Mr. Secretary, welcome back to the committee. You are breaking good news in incredible ways to communities all over this country because of the legislation we passed in the last Congress, and because of your good work implementing it, so, thank you for that. But some of the questions that you have had from across the aisle have been, frankly, just casting about wildly to malign electric vehicles. And I was surprised to hear the suggestion that EV bat- tery fires are somehow a great risk to public health, but no discus- sion of the fossil fuel infrastructure and vehicles and other fossil fuel aspects that are exploding and burning and harming and kill- ing people every day in this country. Could you just sort of speak to the relative threat to human life, safety, and public health as between EV batteries and all of the fossil fuel vehicles, tankers, trucks, pipelines, and refineries that are going boom seemingly every day somewhere in America? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Well, it would certainly be absurd to dis- miss the danger and damage that has been associated with flam- mable liquids being used to propel our vehicles over the course of the last 100 years. Of course, there is a framework of regulation to try to minimize that danger and harm, just as we are building a framework of regulation to make sure that any harm or risk as- sociated with electric or any other propulsion—hydrogen, you name it—is appropriately managed. We just don’t view any of those risks as an excuse to stick to dirty and expensive fuels and older tech- nology that, again, as we have been shown in sometimes shocking fashion, can lead to the destruction of property and life in inci- dents, not to mention the destruction of property and life being doc- umented as a consequence of the pollution. Mr. HUFFMAN. Well said. My colleague from Pennsylvania, Mr. Perry, kind of broke the fact-check machine with some of his at- tacks on electric vehicles. He stated that the cost of electric vehi- cles is going up. Just for the record, Mr. Secretary, I believe that is false. Can you tell us what the cost of electric vehicles is doing these days? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. The cost of electric vehicles is going down, and we have even seen research indicating that, if you look at ap- ples to apples—which can be a little challenging, but the basic de- termination when you compare an EV to a comparable internal combustion engine, according to J.D. Power, is about $53,600 for an EV; $54,400, on average, for the gas vehicle. That is before you ac- count for the $2,000 or so a year that an EV owner can save in fuel costs, and the $6,000 or so in lifetime lower maintenance and re- pair costs, simply because an EV tends to have fewer moving parts. Mr. HUFFMAN. Right. According to my just quick Google search just now, new EV prices are down year over year 18 percent, which is much more than for non-EVs over the same year over year pe- riod. And for used EVs, the prices are down even more, a 27-per- VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00079 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6633 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN70 cent decline in price year over year. So, is that consistent with your understanding of where we are headed on prices? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Yes, and I think it is intuitive if you con- sider how new EV technology is relative to internal combustion technology. In other words, any improvements we see in cost today on an ICE engine or after 100 years of refinement, whereas the stage we are at with EVs might be better compared to where we were when internal combustion got as far as the Model T. More work will hap- pen that will make them more efficient, and it is not surprising that that cost curve is moving down faster for EVs than for ICE cars right now. Mr. HUFFMAN. My colleague also suggested the Federal Govern- ment was buying the majority of EVs in America. You thankfully put that in—I think there is a math problem over there because it was 0.5 percent, according to—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [interrupting]. That is the most recent data that I have seen. Mr. HUFFMAN. Yes, pretty far from a majority. On the issue of why bother—because my colleague from Arkan- sas pointed out that if we electrified our transportation system overnight here in the United States, it would still be only about 1 percent of global emissions—my understanding is that, while U.S. emissions are overall declining, the transportation sector is still going the wrong way. Could you just expand on the sort of ‘‘why bother’’ argument that has been suggested today? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. I think any time there is a national effort, or certainly a human effort that is going to require a lot of different people to hit their marks in order to succeed, that should motivate us to go above and beyond, not to sit on our hands. America has never been the kind of country that waited for other countries to solve a problem. And I believe we need to lead in this regard. As we do, again, we will see not only climate benefits, but a benefit in terms of those deaths from particulate matter that I mentioned earlier. Mr. HUFFMAN. Thank you, Mr. Secretary, and just to close with an invitation to my district in Humboldt County, where you award- ed a $426 million INFRA grant to modernize a port that will sup- port the floating offshore wind industry. We would love to show you that incredible project. It certainly puts a light on the notion that this administration has a build nothing ever agenda. And with that, I yield back. Ms. MALOY. The gentleman yields. The Chair recognizes Mr. Col- lins for 5 minutes. Mr. COLLINS. Thank you, Madam Chair. Good afternoon, Mr. Secretary. I kind of want to take a tour around the transportation industry here for my 5 minutes, but I think everybody is kind of focused on EVs, so, we are going to kind of start in that direction first. There is a 400-plus-billion-dollar backlog in highway repair right now. We got congested interstates, and a lot of that is not due to road maintenance or accidents, it is just congestion. And we don’t even have a diesel engine that will beat the 2027 certifications.

What is the game plan with EV tractors? Because they weigh more than the diesel- equipped class 8 tractors do, and you are going to have to have more trucks on the road just to move the same amount of freight that you do with a diesel engine as you do with an EV. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Yes, trucking is a little different from the personal vehicle and light-duty side, but we are seeing alternative fuels emerge on the trucking side too. The electric is more for lower distance routes than over the road. Hydrogen has also shown a lot of promise when it comes to those over the road routes, but—— Mr. COLLINS [interrupting]. Yes, but I just—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [continuing]. It is not electrifying—— Mr. COLLINS [interrupting]. That is what I just said. The EPA has structured it where we don’t even have an engine for 2027. The majority of the talk again here today has been about EVs, and that is what you have been talking about. I am part of that dirty gas-burning diesel people that you talk about. I am in the trucking industry. So, what is the game plan? Because for every six loads that you haul with an EV truck, you are going to have to have another truck to put in there. Do you know how much an EV class 8 tractor weighs? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Not offhand, no. Mr. COLLINS. 32,000 pounds. Do you know how much a class 8 diesel tractor weighs, decked out with everything? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Less. Mr. COLLINS. 17,000. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Yes. Mr. COLLINS. There is a big discrepancy there. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Yes. Mr. COLLINS. The roads don’t even handle the additional weight. We had one of your people in here not too long ago, and they said they were going to increase the weights that we could carry on the roads. If the roads can handle that, why don’t you do it now so that we can get the congestion off the roads with the diesel engines that we do have out there? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Well, we are certainly working on devel- oping solutions for pavement durability to make sure, as they come under increased pressure, whether it is from traffic, weather, or anything else, that they last longer than—— Mr. COLLINS [interrupting]. I don’t—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [continuing]. They used to. Mr. COLLINS [continuing interruption]. Think you have a solu- tion, EV-wise, really, in reality, for—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [interrupting]. I would say—— Mr. COLLINS [continuing]. Class 8 trucks—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [continuing interruption]. I would certainly say the development of the technology on the trucking side is less advanced and, I think, less likely to lend itself to a single tech- nology than on the light-duty side. Mr. COLLINS. All right, I am burning time. Let’s move on to the aviation side of this thing.

Congress has already passed legislation to make airlines refund passengers. The can- cellation in 2023 was lower by one point some percent than it has been in decades. How do you think the rule—this rule, when it ad- dresses circumstances that are uncontrollable, like when the Gov- ernment’s at fault or when traffic controllers are at fault, is the Government going to pay? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. First of all, thanks for acknowledging the cancellations are down on our watch. When it comes to rules for holding companies accountable, that is—— Mr. COLLINS [interrupting]. Well, I don’t think the cancellations are necessarily due to you. It could be due to the industry—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [interrupting]. Well, I would like to believe that we helped, given the—— Mr. COLLINS [interrupting]. Yes, I know—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [continuing]. Work that we did—— Mr. COLLINS [continuing].

To more efficiently use the air- space. Mr. COLLINS. So, should the Government pay when they are at fault? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Charging the taxpayer for a delay doesn’t make a lot of sense to me. Mr. COLLINS. Well, you talk like it is your funds. I mean, this is the Department of Transportation. Tell me. You want to make the airlines pay when it is their fault. When it is your fault, should you step up and pay? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Again, I don’t understand why you would charge the taxpayer for a problem the way you charge a for-profit company if they fail to live up to the regulations of how they take care of customers. Mr. COLLINS. But you are charging anyone that is at fault. You said who is at fault should pay. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Yes. If it isn’t weather, if it is controllable by the airline—— Mr. COLLINS [interrupting]. If—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [continuing]. Then the airline ought to deal with it—— Mr. COLLINS [continuing interruption]. If it is—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [continuing]. If it is controllable by the FAA, then we come to Congress for help dealing with it. Mr. COLLINS. If it is covered by the Government, then you should step up and pay. That is right.

You mean the—you expect the taxpayer to pay who? Mr. COLLINS. I expect the people at fault to. And if you are going to demand that, you should demand it of yourself to be better. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. So, you don’t think we should fine any com- panies unless we also fine taxpayers? Mr. COLLINS. But I think we both can agree. Don’t you think that, either way, that the person that is going to pay for all this is going to be the person buying the airline ticket? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Well, that is interesting. So, those argu- ments have been raised any time we have tried to hold airlines ac- countable. But what we have seen is there are countries that do this, right, that say if an airline sticks you—— Mr. COLLINS [interrupting]. I realize that, but—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [continuing].

I know that, I understand that—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [continuing]. From the U.S. version, but—— Mr. COLLINS. [continuing interruption]. There is one other thing that I wanted to comment on real quick, and I have got to comment on these rail issues because, the Boeing CEO, he was hammered for not prioritizing safety over DEI initiatives. Norfolk Southern, in their annual shareholders report, said that they were going to focus on DEI initiatives over anything else, and that is what led to that accident. They weren’t hiring people who were qualified to put grease—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [interrupting]. I have never seen a single shred of data or evidence—— Mr. COLLINS.

You may recall I rep- resent the southwest coast of Oregon, and I want to thank Presi- dent Biden, the Department of Transportation, and yourself per- sonally for the work you have done to explore the viability of dif- ferent Federal investment options for the public-private partner- ship for the Port of Coos Bay intermodal project. This project is continuing to move forward. We still need Federal investment, specifically in channel dredging, so U.S. companies don’t have to rely on Canadian ports to move products to middle America. The Canadians are putting billions of dollars and allow- ing foreign interests to put billions of dollars into their ports, and we have the ability to make sure American farmers and manufac- turers have reliable access to international markets, while also bringing back thousands of middle-class jobs to a region that had been economically robust prior to the shutdown of timber harvests and our Federal forests. We can be an economic engine again. And first I just want to say thank you to the administration; thank you to you personally. But for my question, this week, the National Transportation Safety Board adopted its final report on East Palestine, the Ohio derailment, and Federal track safety regulations require railroads to conduct various track safety inspections, which include visual in- spections at specified minimal intervals done by human beings. Now, railroads are increasingly using a technology, as you know—you have spoken about it here today—called automatic track inspections, or ATI, that uses a machine to detect track ge- ometry defects. Now, in order to use ATI track inspection ma- chines, there are no requirements for railroads to waive or suspend Federal rail safety regulations. But railroads have been seeking to waive the required visual track inspections that are done by rail workers. So, I think that we do better when we have labor at the table to figure out how we can use this technology best with a combina- tion of both new technology like ATI and visual human inspection, VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00084 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6633 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN75 as human traffic inspectors look for 23 possible types of track de- fects, while ATI machines can only detect 6 types of track defects. So, a couple of questions are, can you confirm that there are no Federal Railroad Administration regulations that prohibit railroads from running ATI technology as much as they want, without reduc- ing human track inspections, and do you agree or disagree that vis- ual track inspections plus ATI is a safer approach than just using ATI? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Yes, and I appreciate your clarifying ques- tion, because I think sometimes it has been suggested that if we don’t provide a waiver we are preventing somebody from using ATI. Railroads are more than welcome to use this technology. We are just saying it has got to be used in combination with visual inspec- tions. We think of it as a sort of belt and suspenders approach, en- hancing the success of the human inspection regime with new ca- pabilities that these technologies may be able to deliver. So, we will continue to work with the railroads on test programs that assess the effectiveness of that autonomous track geometry measurement in combination with visual inspections. But we also believe it is important to do both. Ms. HOYLE OF OREGON. Thank you. And with that, I would like to invite you to come to the southwest coast, to come visit the Port of Coos Bay to see all the work that we are doing. And again, I can- not tell you what it means to the people of the south coast to have hope that we will have jobs again so that we don’t have to ship our kids to somewhere else for them to have a really good middle-class life.

And thank you, Mr. Secretary, for being here today, and I thank you for what all you have been doing to help deliver some needed resources in my district in south Mississippi. I’ve got several ques- tions I want for us to try to get through today. So, I normally talk kind of slow, so, I will try to pick it up a little bit. So, let’s me and you see if we can’t get through this without us dragging it out too much. So, firstly, your agency is very important to the projects in my district. Starting with the two ports in the district, the Port of Gulfport and the Port of Pascagoula, my hometown, both have a vital role in supply chain in our Nation’s economy. I am aware that the Notices of Funding Opportunity for the PIDP, it stated the Sec- retary may give priority to providing funding to strategic seaports in support of national security requirements, as required by the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act.

Not the only criterion, but certainly one that, to the extent statute calls for it, we consider. Mr. EZELL. OK, very good. It was also brought to my attention there is a high record amount of obligation funds available through the U.S. Department of Transportation. States like Mississippi ben- efit greatly from the additional funds. However, requiring State DOTs to obligate millions of funds in 1 month is just nearly impos- sible. Mr. Secretary, what steps can be put in place to help streamline this process and allow ample time for the State DOTs to obligate these funds? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. We are certainly aware of the pressure that the State DOTs feel when that August redistribution comes around, and we want to make sure that we have as much flexibility as possible. I will note that the President’s budget for 2025 for Federal High- way does have some provisions that would help, we believe, make that easier, more flexible, reduce that pressure. And we would wel- come working with you in a little more detail on that, because we know that it is a very intense exercise on top of the work the DOTs are already doing. Mr. EZELL. OK, thank you. Additionally, can you explain why you requested almost half of what you requested in fiscal year 2024 for fiscal year 2025 for the CRISI grants? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. So, CRISI is an excellent, popular, oversub- scribed, and important program. We are proud of the work we have been able to do with CRISI. We are also trying to color within the lines of the top-line limits provided by the Fiscal Responsibility Act, but are hopeful that there will continue to be adequate funding to do projects. We al- ways get more applications than we can say yes to. Mr. EZELL. Thank you. As we get ready for the hurricane season, it is crucial that U.S. Department of Transportation, along with other relevant State and Federal agencies, coordinate to prepare for the season. Can you tell me what you have been able to do to help coordinate with Mississippi so that we can get ready for hurri- cane season? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. I was just in Mississippi a few days ago, a different part of the State up in the Delta, but I got a sense of how that is already on everybody’s mind there. Mr. EZELL. Yes. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. We are mindful at our Department, too, of the opportunity to work with State DOTs and anybody else we need to coordinate with.

Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Our approach has been to create options and to provide economic support. Whether we are talking about personal EVs or whether we are talking about those low-emission buses that we are buying for a lot of transit agencies, we know that it is not a one-size-fits-all and we want to work with those transit agencies on answers that make sense for them. Mr. EZELL. Very good, and we yield back with 22 seconds. Thank you. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Thank you. Ms. MALOY. The gentleman yields. The Chair recognizes Mr. Allred for 5 minutes. Mr. ALLRED. Well, thank you, Madam Chair. And thank you, Mr. Secretary, for joining us again. I appreciate your patience today. I want to thank you for your continued sup- port in getting the IIJA funding out of DC and into our commu- nities. This legislation has had a significant impact in north Texas, and will continue to shape our community for years to come. In fact, you just mentioned low-emission buses. In June of last year, DART, the Dallas Area Rapid Transit agency, received a $103 million Fed- eral transit grant to help us modernize our bus fleet. In March of this year, the Southern Gateway Park and Klyde Warren Park and other north Texas projects received $80 million in funding from U.S. DOT, thanks to grants as part of the Bipartisan Infrastruc- ture Law or the IIJA. But one project that you and I have discussed several times in this setting that I would like to highlight is Amtrak’s partnership with Texas Central to develop a high-speed rail connecting Dallas and Houston, two of the largest metropolitan areas in Texas and the country. In December of 2023, the project was awarded a $500,000 grant as part of the Corridor ID program funded through the IIJA. And this now public-private partnership, I think, is a great example of this administration’s and our commitment to envi- ronmentally sustainable transportation while simultaneously sup- porting economic growth. And so, you talked a little bit about this when you were last in Dallas on TV. But here could you just mention a little bit about how serious your agency is and you are about high-speed rail in Texas? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Thank you. We are enthusiastic about the potential. And the funding that comes with this Corridor ID des- ignation is both direct funding for planning activities and a signal of the potential that we see. When you look across the geography of the United States, the best candidates for high-speed rail service are geographies where you have two major metropolitan areas that are fairly close to each other, but really a short flight that borders on the realm of imprac- ticality or a long drive that also borders on the realm of imprac- ticality. And creating that third option of a good, high-speed ride can, we think, unlock enormous economic potential and, even for VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00087 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6633 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN78 the people who don’t use it, bring benefits in the form of reduced congestion on those roadways and those airports. So, we look forward to seeing this proposal continue to develop, and I would be surprised if it did not lead to more applications for support as the vision continues to take shape. Mr. ALLRED. I think that is right. And you mentioned, of course, reducing congestion. I have made that drive many times from Dal- las and Houston. It is not an easy drive. The flight is not always the most convenient option. To me this would just spur so much economic growth, and it is a commonsense idea. But there is also the technology involved in it that I just wanted to briefly discuss, which is—I think it is the Shinkansen bullet train, which is made in Japan. It is the world’s safest transpor- tation technology, really, in many ways, operating without a fatal- ity since 1964. Can you speak about your experience with this tech- nology? And I understand that you might have had a chance to ride on one of these. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Yes, I had the privilege of riding on the Shinkansen train in Japan when I was attending the G7 meetings hosted by Japan last year for transportation ministers and my counterparts. It was an extraordinary experience, especially sitting up in that cab, where I had an opportunity to observe the operator, and seeing the operations center behind the scenes where they con- duct those safe and efficient operations. It is rare for them to be more than a few seconds at variance from their published schedule. And as you mentioned, in a tech- nology and a train going back to the 1960s, they have an unbeliev- able safety record, too. I think any American who sees that comes home and says, ‘‘Why can’t we have something like this?’’ and I think that is the kind of quality and the kind of efficiency that we should aspire to here in the U.S. Mr. ALLRED. I am convinced that if we get one of these lines in Texas, we will get more. We are a perfect candidate for this. And really quickly, in the last 30 seconds I have here, I just want to commend you, as the father of two small kids—I know your growing family—and to highlight the fact that passengers will no longer have to pay more to sit next to their kids on flights. To me, this is just common sense, but it is the kind of thing that really can make an impact in people’s lives, and I think it is an example of your leadership. And at some point in our next discussion, I would love to talk to you about our air traffic controllers and how this FAA bill is going to help us restore that workforce. But with that, I will yield back. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Thank you. Ms. MALOY. The gentleman yields. Mr. Duarte is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. DUARTE. Hello, Secretary. Thank you for joining us here today. The last time we were here, we talked about two things. One was the high-speed rail project in my district, which is the Cali- fornia high-speed rail project, the $128 billion high-speed rail project that was a State initiative that will move from Merced, a city of 60,000, down to Bakersfield, a city of approximately 350,000, I believe.

Secretary BUTTIGIEG. On their own and in a vacuum, it is un- likely that they would generate that justification. But of course, that Merced-to-Bakersfield segment represents a step toward con- necting two of the largest economic areas in the United States. Mr. DUARTE. So, after we have spent $128 billion going over flat land between Merced and Bakersfield, we will then think about how we are going to get through the mountains and the urban areas of Los Angeles and the bay area to then finish the high-speed rail project someday in the distant, distant future? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Well, the Bakersfield-to-Merced segment comes first. And yes, as I understand it, the vision of the project sponsors is ultimately to fully connect all the way—— Mr. DUARTE [interrupting]. You can’t—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [continuing]. Through to the downtowns of those two regions. Mr. DUARTE. Are you capable of recognizing a hopeless boon- doggle? Because that is what we are discussing right now. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. I have seen a lot of the most compelling and ambitious human projects characterized as hopeless boon- doggles during the time that they were taking shape, and I am not surprised, for a project that represents the first movement in the United States of America toward this kind of technology, that it has proven to present a lot of challenges for those first movers. Mr. DUARTE. Thank you. Let’s move on to something even more important, in my opinion. Representative Owens, a good friend of mine, earlier discussed the electric vehicle trade, the proxy imperialism that American tax- payers are sponsoring in the Congo in the pursuit of cobalt. I don’t know, I guess God shined on us today because, just walking in the atrium of Rayburn Office Building here, we have a Congolese dele- gation talk about economic development in Congo. So, I got a quote from Abraham Leno, who was sitting in here a few a little while ago, but his schedule does not permit for him to be here right now. Nonetheless, I would encourage you to speak to him on your way through there today. Let me quote Abraham Leno. He actually provided me a quote that I will read verbatim: ‘‘Children are working in situations with exposure to chemicals like mercury, and going into mines with no safety regulations or over- sight. Beyond the daily tragedy, Congo is losing the productive labor force of the future and people who would contribute to a brighter future with a stronger civil society.’’ I have read the book—or at least audio-booked, I will admit— ‘‘Cobalt Red.’’ As you pursue these electric vehicle technologies, this—you call it technology, but technology, in my book, makes lives better. I don’t see electric vehicles making lives tremendously better here in the United States. They are crushing lives around the world. We have got slave trade in Congo—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [interrupting]. I just don’t—— Mr. DUARTE [continuing]. You have got slave labor—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [continuing interruption]. I just can’t accept that that is a necessary consequence—— VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00089 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6633 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN80 Mr. DUARTE [interrupting]. Then don’t accept it. Secretary BUTTIGIEG [continuing]. Of newer technology. Mr. DUARTE. Don’t accept it. If you feel a glow driving an electric vehicle here today in America, go ahead and feel that. There are children in mines being crushed. There are families being broken. There are warlords forcing these people into slavery around the world. Provide that—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [interrupting]. And I trust anyone serious about confronting that—— Mr. DUARTE [continuing]. Provide that glow, or whatever you feel driving an electric vehicle today—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [continuing interruption]. Will join us in en- forcing our protections against forced and child labor. Mr. DUARTE. You—that is your value system, I can appreciate it. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. I must also say that I am puzzled to find people who have shown—— Mr. DUARTE [interrupting]. If you want to support world slavery, and you—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [continuing]. No interest in dealing with forced and child labor in any other product suddenly become con- cerned about it. Mr. DUARTE. You are forcing child labor in the Congo. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. No. Mr. DUARTE. It is documented. It has been known for decades. You want to talk about reparations? Your party wants to talk about proxy imperialism in our history? We are practicing impe- rialism today through the Chinese Communist government going in to extract the minerals necessary—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [interrupting]. We are competing with the Chinese Communist government to build this on U.S. soil. Mr. DUARTE [continuing]. You are—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [interrupting]. And we wish we would have your help on that. Mr. DUARTE. You are subsidizing the Chinese Government today with your EV—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [interrupting]. We are subsidizing the American auto industry. Mr. DUARTE. You are subsidizing—you are not going to tell me you believe—go ahead. Tell me you believe that the majority of bat- teries produced for American EVs that are receiving Federal sub- sidies today are being produced with constituents and components sourced in America and are slavery free. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. What I can tell you is that today’s EV—— Mr. DUARTE [interrupting]. No, that is a very simple statement. Do you believe the constituent components in American electric ve- hicles being subsidized by our Government today are slavery free? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Here is what I can tell you. Eighty percent less cobalt is going into today’s EV batteries. Most of the cobalt that is used comes as a byproduct from nickel and copper mining and major battery makers—— Mr. DUARTE [interrupting]. So, you don’t want to end slavery. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Could you please let me finish the sen- tence?

I asked you about slav- ery, you are telling me about constituents in other components. Just answer the question I actually asked, which is: Do you believe the electric vehicles being produced and subsidized by American taxpayers today are slavery-free, fair-trade vehicles? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. I should certainly hope that they are. And if there is any specific evidence of any violation of any provision to prevent forced and child labor of any product, any of the 159 prod- ucts listed—— Mr. DUARTE [interrupting]. Will you speak to our friends from the Congo—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [continuing]. We will work on that. Mr. DUARTE [continuing interruption]. After—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [continuing]. Now, what I would also—look, we can do one of—— Mr. DUARTE [continuing interruption]. Will you speak to our friends from the Congo out here in the atrium on your way out? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. I am just astonished that people who have shown zero interest—— Mr. DUARTE [continuing interruption]. Will you—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [continuing]. In confronting forced or child labor on any of the other 158 products listed are suddenly terribly concerned about it on this one product—— Mr. DUARTE [interrupting]. We are subsidizing this with Amer- ican taxpayer—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [continuing]. Which we can actually do without that much cobalt. Mr. DUARTE. This isn’t just about unfair competition, this is about subsidizing child labor through American policy. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Then why didn’t you vote for the provision to move it onto U.S. soil? Ms. MALOY. The time has expired. The gentleman’s time has ex- pired. Mr. DUARTE. Thank you, I yield back. Ms. MALOY. The gentleman yields back. Mr. Moulton is recog- nized for 5 minutes. Mr. MOULTON. Thank you very much, Madam Chairwoman. Mr. Secretary, good to see you. Thank you very much for joining us here today. I would actually like to start exactly where my col- league began, with California high-speed rail. I understand the project is over budget. It is not a model for project completion. I understand there is a lot of frustration with its starting in the mid- dle, as opposed to starting at the end. But I have one very simple question for you. To meet 2050 travel demand in California, will it cost less tax- payer dollars or more taxpayer dollars to meet that with high- speed rail or by expanding highways and airports? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. In my estimation, a highway and airport- only approach would cost more. Mr. MOULTON. There is a lot of documentation and studies that show that, too. So, I agree with my colleague that this should be run more efficiently. I also think taxpayer dollars should get a good return on investment, a better return than they are getting today. And at the end of the day, we need to solve these transportation VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00091 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6633 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN82 problems efficiently and in a 21st-century way that uses taxpayer dollars more efficiently than just building more airports and high- ways where people can still sit on tarmac in thunderstorms, fight traffic on ever-congested highways, as opposed to going 200 miles per hour or 220 miles per hour like the rest of the world. So, I hope we can pursue that more vigorously. Right now, of course, if you want to build an interstate highway, you get a ton of money from the Federal Government. If you want to build an airport, you get a ton of money from the Federal Gov- ernment. We have a Highway Trust Fund. We have an Airport Trust Fund. We don’t have any rail trust fund whatsoever. There is not even just a simple level playing field so that the famous American free market can make these business decisions about which mode is best, because I am sure there are places where high- speed rail doesn’t make sense, it would cost more to solve certain transportation problems. But in places where you get a better ROI, we should be choosing high-speed rail. That is not an option really for States today. What can we do to ensure proper Federal funding to at least level the playing field so that transportation planners can just say let’s make an honest, business-based decision about how to solve this congestion problem? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Thank you for the question. I think the key is to make sure we build on what we can demonstrate with the funding that we have now. What came in the IIJA was a step change in our ability to support passenger rail but, as you know, nowhere near what it will take to build a fully built-out U.S. high- speed rail network. I also am convinced, though, that when Americans experience high-speed rail and revenue service on U.S. soil, there will be no going back. It is part of why it is so important to effectively deliver those projects now underway, California and Brightline—— Mr. MOULTON [interrupting]. Well, I have made this point to you since before you were sworn in. It is proven internationally. A ton of resistance to building the first high-speed rail line in Spain, ten- tacles for Madrid. All the provinces said as soon as Barcelona got their line, every other province wanted one, too. And the Spanish Government has made business-based decisions about where high- speed rail makes sense. They now have a national network. I think we need to look at that very carefully. Now, while this hearing was happening, there was a 20-car Ca- nadian national derailment outside of Chicago, including some hazmat cars in Madison, Illinois. It is clear that we can make more progress on freight rail safety, and I think we need some bipartisan legislation that will not take us back to the 1950s, but move us for- ward, push the industry forward to hopefully not only improve safety, but improve reliability and service, as well. How do we develop freight rail legislation that doesn’t just push more traffic onto trucks? Because we want our railways to be safer, but we don’t want them to not be used. Because even in the horrific derailment in East Palestine, exactly zero people were killed. Every week on the highways, people die in hazmat accidents because that traffic is on trucks and not on trains.

You make an incredibly important point, which is that, pound for pound, rail transport is safer and less pol- luting than alternatives. Of course, trucks play a vitally important role, but in terms of making sure that we fully use our rail net- works, there is a benefit to that many times over in congestion, air quality, emissions, and safety. So, that means we have to do, I think, a couple of things. First of all, ensure the safety of freight rail. And I think that the bipartisan legislation being considered in this Chamber would help with that. And secondly, I think that the companies need to invest in capac- ity. Unfortunately, under the so-called Precision Scheduled Rail- roading approach, leaders of those Class I freight railroads are under pressure to extract as much value as they can out of their railroads without really investing in capacity. Mr. MOULTON. Yes, I agree with you, Mr. Secretary. I am almost out of time. I just want to extend this point to passenger rail, as well. When we spend billions of dollars subsidizing people to get into more cars, as an inevitable result of the EV policy, then we are going to have more congestion on our highways. We are going to have a lot of silent traffic jams, but they are still going to be traffic jams. We have got to level the playing field, and make sure Americans have the choices and the freedom to travel at 200 miles per hour, like the rest of the world. Thank you, I yield back.

The Biden administration is on a mission to force consumers to buy electric vehicles that they clearly don’t want. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. No, we are not. Mr. BEAN OF FLORIDA. Of the 282 million—well, let me tell you, Mr. Secretary, you are, because the Biden administration is spend- ing billions, billions in subsidies to force consumers to make these decisions. Two hundred and eighty-two million vehicles are on the roads today, 1 percent are electric. And they are only buying them because we are bribing consumers with $7,500 to purchase that ve- hicle.

Listen, when we build roads, we use ag- gregates and other—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [interposing]. We do. Mr. BEAN OF FLORIDA [continuing]. Rocks and materials. One of the companies that has part of their headquarters in Jacksonville, Florida, is Vulcan. Two years ago, Mexico took over their aggregate plant. They just walked in. The government walked in, took their plant, hasn’t compensated them at all. And since that time, aggre- gate and building roads and building anything in America has gone up. Is that on your radar screen of how we can get this plant back, or get American assets that were taken over by Mexico? Is that on your radar screen? Are you aware? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. I am not familiar with this plant, but I would love to learn more. Pavement is actually one of my unfashionable passions. I think that if we do better with pavement durability and sourcing—— Mr. BEAN OF FLORIDA [interrupting]. OK, just know that—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [continuing].

And I got one more question, and hopefully we can bring it in for a landing, and that is turbulence. Everybody who knows me knows I am scared of two things, clowns and turbulence.

Mayor Pete, you know that there is no better investment than public in- frastructure. In the 3 years since the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law was signed, our country, especially Arizona, has benefited. In fact, just last week, Valley Metro received over $15 million to ex- pand the streetcar system from the city of Tempe into the city of Mesa. And in January, Arizona received a $95 million INFRA grant to widen Interstate 10. And that investment directly benefits the Gila River Indian Community, helping fulfill the administra- tion’s goal to direct 40 percent of infrastructure dollars to histori- cally disadvantaged communities. And I know you agree the success of the 22 federally recognized Tribes is critical to all of Arizona, just like Tribal communities all across the United States of America. You know we have not kept up our treaty obligations to our Tribal partners, especially in underinvestment in infrastructure. And this administration wants equity in transportation investments, I applaud that. What are you and DOT doing specifically to channel investment to our Tribes and Tribal communities? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Well, thanks for the question. Every time I am in Indian country, I see the extraordinary need and the de- mand that those Tribal governments face, maintaining often ex- traordinarily extensive road networks with shockingly little by way of funding. It is one of the reasons we have worked to increase sup- port for Tribal as well as rural communities, and we have been pleased to see a lot of success in terms of some of the competitive grant processes, including, as you mentioned, the Gila River Indian Community. I am really excited about what we can do with them on I–10. We now have an Assistant Secretary-level office for supporting Tribal communities, all 574 of them, and specific programs, includ- ing our Tribal Technical Assistance Program, to help make sure that these communities can succeed not just in winning those grants, but also in delivering them, because we know it can be a real challenge after you get the good news, to see those processes through. Mr. STANTON. That is great. Mr. Secretary, you and I have both heard so many horror stories about the air travel experience for passengers with disabilities, particularly people who utilize mobil- ity devices. This committee has worked hard on this issue on the recently passed FAA reauthorization, including a couple of bills that I authored to make the travel experience better. You have made this a priority, as well. Why is this important, and what more work do we have to do to support passengers with disabil- ities? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. When you talk to passengers with disabil- ities, particularly wheelchair users, you hear so many stories of the experiences that they have had that reflect, really, a lack of access to safe and dignified air travel. So, we have issued a final rule that is requiring airlines to make lavatories on new, single-aisle aircraft large enough for passengers with wheelchairs after hearing stories of passengers who either dehydrate themselves or just don’t fly at all because they don’t have access to an accessible bathroom.

Some wheelchair users have told me that arriving in a destination without a wheelchair is like arriving without your legs. And it doesn’t just ruin your trip, but if an airline takes for- ever to fix it, that affects you long after you have returned home. So, we are going to continue to work with advocates, and we are going to take a tough line on any violations here, because it really is just unacceptable for passengers to go through what some pas- sengers tell us about. Mr. STANTON. I very much look forward to working with you on that, because it stops job opportunities and so many other ways that it impacts the lives of people with disabilities who are talented and deserve to have the passenger experience improved. As mayor of Phoenix, I proposed and asked voters to approve the single largest transportation infrastructure plan in Arizona history, the first of its kind and scope, to expand public transit, including our light rail system, and modernize our roadways. They did, by an overwhelming margin. This year, the people of Maricopa County will decide again with Prop 479, a proposed dedicated half-cent sales tax extension to fund critical transportation. Mr. Secretary, as communities across the country vie for competi- tive Federal funding, explain why it is important for States and lo- calities to have their own dedicated transportation funding source to be competitive for those grants. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Well, I appreciate the question because, with the historic funding available through the Bipartisan Infra- structure Law, I don’t want anybody to get the idea that that means States or local governments shouldn’t do much. The reality is, the more you can put together on a State or local basis, the more you can unlock on the Federal side, and the better partner we can be. So, we applaud cities and States that are taking the ini- tiative to fund their infrastructure needs, knowing that we have a wind at their back in the form of the programs and grants we have. Mr. STANTON. Thank you very much. I yield back. Ms. MALOY. The gentleman yields. Mr. Kiley is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. KILEY. Good afternoon, Mr. Secretary. You have testified today on the topic of EVs that there is no mandate. You have said that we have not forced anyone to purchase any particular vehicle. You have testified that you want power to be in the hands of con- sumers. Is that a fair characterization of your testimony? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. That we don’t have an EV mandate? That is correct. Mr. KILEY. That is correct. OK. So, I am of a similar view. I don’t think that we—I am all for EVs. I have a lot of constituents who buy them, and I think that you are right, that there will be an in- creasing adoption of them going forward. However, I support the right of consumers to make their own choice. So, it sounds like we are on the same page there. So, do you, like me, then oppose Cali- fornia’s effort to take that choice away from consumers by banning gas-powered vehicles?

We respect that States can make their own decisions about State policies. But at a Federal level, our approach has to do with economic incentives and support for chargers, not any kind of mandate coming out of the DOT on what technology you are supposed to buy for your vehicle. Mr. KILEY. Sure. But you have said you support giving choice to consumers. Now you have said you support giving choice to States. But those two are conflicting, because the State is taking that right away from consumers. So, why is it that you side with giving the State the choice, as opposed to giving the consumer the choice? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Because this is Federal policy. I make Fed- eral policy, and our Federal policy is to support consumer choice. But look, sometimes our Federal policy is a floor, and States decide to go above and beyond that. Mr. KILEY. Sure. But as you are aware, the Federal Government has actually given California the authority to issue that ban through a waiver under the Clean Air Act. So, do you support the conferral of that waiver? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. I think that is on the EPA side of the House, so, I want to make sure that I am conscious of the—— Mr. KILEY [interposing]. I understand. Secretary BUTTIGIEG [continuing]. Jurisdictional differences. But—and I am not informed enough on EPA’s processes to weigh in on their policy choices. What I will say again is that, at the Federal level in the Biden- Harris administration, our strategy with regard to EVs is to make sure there are more chargers out there, and to make them more affordable. Mr. KILEY. Sure, but I just want to—I am trying to parse out your position, because on the one hand you say you favor giving consumers choice, and yet on the other hand you seem to be stand- ing behind an administration policy that is enabling the biggest State in the country to take that choice away. So, which is it? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. I am talking about Federal policy when I talk about not—— Mr. KILEY [interrupting]. And Federal policy is enabling this choice that now California is also bringing 18 other States along with. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Yes, enabling, not requiring. Mr. KILEY. So, do you support legislation to take that waiver away? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. You mean Federal legislation to preempt the ability of States to make their own decisions? Mr. KILEY. No, no, no. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. As a general rule, no. Mr. KILEY. That is not correct. It is a special authority that has been granted to the States to make that decision. So, you are sup- porting granting special authority to ban gas-powered vehicles, cor- rect? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. States may seek waivers. And if they qual- ify under the law, we will consider them. Again, I don’t want to get into the weeds of something that another agency is doing because I am not privy to all—— VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00099 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6633 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN90 Mr. KILEY [interrupting]. But you are the Secretary of Transpor- tation, and this is a massive question of transportation policy. So, I was just wondering if you had a view, yes or no. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Yes, I mean, look, there are many cases where States have led the way by going above and beyond a Fed- eral floor. Mr. KILEY. Sure. Let’s turn to high-speed rail for a moment. Your administration has given—or your Department has given $3.1 bil- lion to this project recently. Is that correct? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. That is correct. Mr. KILEY. And the Governor of California said this show of sup- port from the Biden-Harris administration is a vote of confidence in today’s vision for that project. Do you agree with that statement from Governor Newsom, that you have—your confidence in the cur- rent vision for California high-speed rail? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. We don’t approve awards for any project if we are not confident in the integrity of the application—— Mr. KILEY [interposing]. Sure. Secretary BUTTIGIEG [continuing]. And the ability of the project sponsor to meet whatever is required for them through the applica- tion process—— Mr. KILEY [interrupting]. But you are aware that the project has been a nightmare in California, correct? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. It is kind of a subjective question. What I am aware of is it is creating a lot of good-paying jobs, it has taken a long time, and it is a good investment. Mr. KILEY. Well, this is actually the term the New York Times used in an article, ‘‘How California’s Bullet Train Went Off the Rails.’’ It called it a multibillion-dollar nightmare. The L.A. Times reported it is $100 billion short in funding right now, and the New York Times also said that it is not on track to be finished this cen- tury, that it is not on track to be finished this century. Do you dis- agree? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. I would be surprised if it took until the end of this century to deliver quality, high-speed rail in California. So, I suppose in that respect—— Mr. KILEY [interrupting]. When do you think it will be finished? Secretary BUTTIGIEG [continuing]. I disagree. I didn’t hear you, sorry. Mr. KILEY. When do you think it will be finished? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. I have seen projections for when the Merced-to-Bakersfield segment will come online. We are looking to the next decade, for sure, for the bulk of the revenue service. Mr. KILEY. OK, but you earlier stated, in response to my col- league from California’s questions, that the sort of funding is predi- cated on it ultimately going from L.A. to San Francisco. So, I am asking, when do you think that will be completed? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. I am not going to get ahead of the high- speed rail authority there on their latest projections for when fu- ture stages—— Mr. KILEY [interrupting]. Well, no, you—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [continuing]. Could be completed. Mr. KILEY. You have already gotten there. You have given them $3.1 billion.

Well, obviously, the moment it is in rev- enue service it is a benefit to some California consumers. Mr. KILEY. Right. So, do you think it will be before the century? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Yes.

What is your best estimate for when we will have operational, high-speed rail for—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [interrupting]. I am not going to estimate a year for the San Francisco-to-L.A. corridor. Mr. KILEY. OK. Do you think that the technology will still be state of the art by the time it is complete? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. I think the technology will be a lot better than what Americans are accustomed to today. Mr. KILEY. Thank you, I yield back. Ms. MALOY. The gentleman yields. The Chair recognizes Mr. Menendez for 5 minutes. Mr. MENENDEZ. Thank you, Madam Chair. Secretary Buttigieg, thank you for being here today and all the important work that the Department of Transportation carries out every day. While we appreciate everything the Department is doing to facili- tate the historic Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and im- prove transportation across the country, our constituents are deal- ing with serious issues during their day-to-day commutes. Several times over the past month, NJ Transit riders have experienced sig- nificant delays during their daily commutes. These delays have left commuters stranded for hours, impacting their ability to work, travel, and see loved ones. Over the course of the last 6 weeks, Amtrak disruptions have caused delays for NJ Transit riders over 20 times, including serious incidents last week that resulted in cancellations and suspension of service along the Northeast Corridor. Amtrak cites overhead wire and other infrastructure issues as the sources of these delays. This week, I, along with Representative Mikie Sherrill, led the New Jersey delegation in sending you a letter, here, highlighting our concerns with persistent delays in Amtrak’s failure to ade- quately address these issues. Madam Chair, I ask for unanimous consent to submit this letter for the record. Ms. MALOY. Without objection.

Pete Buttigieg, Secretary, U.S. Department of Transportation, from the New Jersey Congressional Delegation, Sub- mitted for the Record by Hon. Robert Menendez CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES, HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, WASHINGTON, DC 20515, JUNE 25, 2024. The Honorable PETE BUTTIGIEG, Secretary, U.S. Department of Transportation, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, S.E., Washington, DC 20590. DEAR SECRETARY BUTTIGIEG: Families across New Jersey count on accessible, efficient public transportation to get to work on time, be home for their children’s soccer games, and make their lives more affordable and convenient. As the most densely populated state in the nation, New Jersey in particular has a unique reliance on public transportation and our passenger rail system to move our economy and communities forward. Given the centrality of Amtrak and NJ TRANSIT to these crucial goals and our long-running support in Congress for key investments in our region’s railway network, we have been shocked and deeply concerned by the recent breakdown in Amtrak rail oper- ations along the Northeast Corridor and the resulting many hours of delays for tens of thousands of New Jersey commuters. Over the past week, our offices have been inundated with outreach from our con- stituents regarding dramatic delays in their Amtrak and NJ TRANSIT commutes that have greatly impacted their ability to work, travel, and see loved ones. On Thursday, June 20, Amtrak service along the entirety of the Northeast Corridor in New Jersey, particularly between Manhattan and Philadelphia, was suspended due to power issues as a result of malfunctioning circuit breakers on Amtrak tracks, alongside a brush fire in Secaucus that led to additional issues. Since some 60 per- cent of NJ TRANSIT’s nearly 700 daily trains must use the Northeast Corridor for some or all of their trips—and 80 percent of NJ TRANSIT passenger rail trips touch the Northeast Corridor—all NJ TRANSIT service into and out of New York Penn Station was also suspended for the afternoon. More than 130 NJ TRANSIT trains were canceled or delayed, and thousands of New Jerseyans were stuck far from home for hours and were unable to have dinner with their families on Thursday night, as a result of these avoidable errors by Amtrak. Again, on the morning of Friday, June 21, NJ TRANSIT customers were trapped in a commuting nightmare as service was suspended in and out of New York Penn Station due to Amtrak power problems. Many commuters undoubtedly gave up in disgust, either working from home, if they could, or climbing into their cars and fighting highway traffic, adding to our serious regional air pollution. Unfortunately, these are not isolated incidents. Not counting the chaos last Thurs- day and Friday, Amtrak disruptions have created serious delays for NJ TRANSIT customers no less than 19 times over the past six weeks. These serious issues are occurring nowhere else on the 11 rail lines that NJ TRANSIT owns and maintains, only on Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor. This is especially frustrating for New Jersey citizens and their elected representa- tives, as NJ TRANSIT is merely a tenant on Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor; NJ TRANSIT neither owns nor maintains the Corridor. Amtrak does, and Amtrak’s troubles leave NJ TRANSIT in an impossible position—unable to direct repairs on Amtrak property and unable to provide proper, reliable service to paying customers who depend on them. This is seriously undermining the quality of life for New Jerseyans and their families, and if it continues it will threaten the state’s economic health. Needless to say, this situation is completely unacceptable. As Amtrak works to address the underlying infrastructure problems that led to these delays, we therefore ask that the Department of Transportation conduct a thorough investigation into what led to the breakdowns along the Northeast Cor- ridor route and what additional capital projects need to be completed to fix any structural deficiencies, and to present its findings to Members of Congress. We also ask that the Department provide information as to how it and Amtrak are planning to adapt to a greater frequency of extreme heat waves throughout the Northeast re- gion, which likely played a role in last week’s significant delays, and better commu- nicate and coordinate with operators on Amtrak’s lines, including NJ TRANSIT, in real time as issues arise. As these types of weather events are only expected to in- crease in frequency going forward, it is critical that Amtrak, NJ TRANSIT, and the VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00102 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN93 Department of Transportation work together to ensure that these transportation breakdowns don’t happen again and that we are better prepared in case major cir- cuit breaker malfunctions or other issues occur. Additionally, we urge Amtrak to immediately prioritize replacement of catenary wires and other critical infrastructure upgrades such as signals and track using the funds allocated through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. These federal invest- ments were made to ensure reliable train service and must be utilized promptly to prevent further severe disruptions along the Northeast Corridor. Thank you for your attention to this critical matter that has greatly impacted families and businesses all throughout New Jersey. We have been proud to support significant new investments in public rail transportation throughout our region, in- cluding the Gateway program, but the breakdowns that we’ve seen last week and over the past month-plus are incredibly disruptive and only serve to deter families in our districts from taking the train in the first place. We look forward to working with you to resolve these issues and ensure that Amtrak and NJ TRANSIT emerge far stronger from this crisis. Sincerely, MIKIE SHERRILL, DONALD NORCROSS, Member of Congress.

ANDY KIM, Member of Congress. cc: Coalition for the Northeast Corridor Mr. MENENDEZ. Thank you. We make several requests in the letter, including asking the De- partment to conduct a thorough investigation to what led to the breakdowns along the Northeast Corridor route. I want to just put this in human terms. We both have young families. Imagine leaving for work and assuming that you will be able to get back to your children relying on public transportation. We want to relieve congestion, we want people to use mass transit. Imagine walking out your door and not knowing when you will be able to get back home. So, in your words, please, what is the De- partment doing to partner with Amtrak to ensure that breakdowns like this never happen again? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Well, we know that commuters on NJ Transit have been subject to infuriating delays, as you have de- scribed, and FRA personnel are involved on the ground, assessing what took place and trying to get an understanding of the causes of what appears to be physical damage to NJ Transit cars oper- ating—for some of their trip, at least—on Amtrak resources. I am aware that earlier today, Amtrak and NJ Transit an- nounced a joint action plan. I haven’t had a chance to review that. But one thing I will also direct FRA to do is to support in any way that they can that process, whether it is technical assistance, as- sessment. And of course, more broadly, we are working to support both NJ Transit and Amtrak with the capital funding they need. Too soon to know exactly which issues have contributed to this, but I think it is safe to expect that, more broadly, reliability depends on good VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00103 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6633 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN94 state of repair. State of good repair is better served by the infra- structure funding that we are getting to them. Mr. MENENDEZ. Absolutely, and I appreciate your support. I am just asking to treat this like the crisis that it is, because we are hearing from our residents every single day who don’t want to go to work, who don’t want to travel, who are worried about what childcare looks like because they are not sure—there is no reli- ability. And it is a crisis for so many residents. I am asking you to treat it as such. Mr. Secretary, how can we ensure that Amtrak and other rail line owners are making infrastructure improvements and upgrades that result in better service? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Well, partly what we can do is directly help. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act gives us unprece- dented resources to help the various infrastructure owners. Some- times it is Amtrak that New Jersey Transit counts on, sometimes it is a Class I freight railer that Amtrak counts on. I also believe the Surface Transportation Board’s work of stepped up enforcement and attention to the legal responsibility that host railroads have to allow passenger rail to take priority is an impor- tant part of this, and we welcome the attention that the STB is paying to that. And anything else we can do to support those proc- esses is certainly something of great interest to us because on-time performance and reliability is vital for the reasons you just went through in terms of people’s daily lives. Mr. MENENDEZ. I appreciate that. And on this topic, lastly, can you describe how the Department tracks and monitors Amtrak spending, including how Amtrak allocates its funding to state of good repair versus other initiatives? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. I know that the Department receives ex- tensive documentation from Amtrak. I wouldn’t be in a position, off the cuff, to characterize some of the breakdowns that appear there, but given Amtrak’s unique kind of quasi-public structure, it is sub- ject to a lot of requirements around transparency. And of course, we get the challenge they face in balancing oper- ations and maintenance personnel and their capital needs. Our ability to support them is mostly, of course, on the capital side, but we are also a stakeholder just in the sense that a lot of funding through our Department or from our Department goes to Amtrak to help them meet those needs. Mr. MENENDEZ. I appreciate it, because this is why I appreciate the Gateway Program and all these long-term projects that are so critically important to the region. It is the day-to-day issues that matter to our residents and I know matter to you. So, I appreciate your partnership. I appreciate you putting the full weight of the Department behind this issue, and we work on this in a collabo- rative fashion so we can get it done. With that, I yield back. Thank you so much, again. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Thank you. Ms. MALOY. The gentleman yields. Mr. Molinaro is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. MOLINARO. Thank you, Madam Chair.

I want to commend the Department’s advancement in aviation for those with physical disabilities, in fact, making some strides. And we appreciate that, of course. Within the FAA reauthorization, we put some emphasis. I would ask for equal consideration for those with intellectual and developmental disabil- ities. We are simply not making adequate progress in any area of mass transportation when it comes to those that are neurodivergent, which gets me to my first question. A year ago, we spoke about Amtrak’s, what I will say, deplorable adherence to the ADA standards. They were given 20 years to ad- vance access to their intercity rail. They are currently, all these years later—from 1990, the adoption of ADA to today, only 30 per- cent of the 385 stations have met that ADA compliance. A year ago—and again, I know the plate is full, but a year ago, we talked briefly about what the Department could do to advance and pres- sure Amtrak to make commitments and meet those benchmarks. Could you at least advise what can and has the Department done to put pressure on Amtrak to meet those expectations? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. I know this has been a topic of discussion with FRA and Amtrak and also, of course, is in scope for what we have since been able to do a lot on more broadly in our transit and transportation systems, which is the ASAP funding that is helping us to retrofit old stations. But the need is enormous. So, there are really two ways to come at this. One is support for capital improvements that are needed to get this done, but the other also is the enforcement side of the house. And so, we do have a title VI capabilities any time there is a more specific—— Mr. MOLINARO [interrupting]. Has the—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [continuing]. Civil rights-related—— Mr. MOLINARO [continuing interruption]. How often does the De- partment take action using the enforcement mechanism as it re- lates to ADA compliance at Amtrak? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. I would have to go back and pull that data. Mr. MOLINARO. It would be helpful, because I suspect—and this is not just your administration, but prior administrations have al- lowed far too much leeway. And quite frankly, this population is just being unmet. And it truly is a disgrace and a violation of their own civil rights, if not simply an acknowledgment that there is lack of access. Similarly, I have a concern as it relates to New York State’s abandonment of congestion pricing. I know one of my colleagues may have mentioned it earlier. I will be candid with you. I think in New York State, congestion pricing actually causes a greater pain for those who can afford it least, in particular those who are forced to commute into the city of New York for employment. Did the Governor of the State of New York provide prior notice to the Department of Transportation that, in fact, the State would aban- don congestion pricing? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. I did get a call from the Governor that she was planning to take that step. Mr. MOLINARO. Was that 24, 36, 48 hours before the announce- ment? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. I don’t recall what day it was, but it was that same week. VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00105 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6633 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN96 Mr. MOLINARO. It was almost immediately prior to that an- nouncement. Subsequent to her announcement, the DOT offered some addi- tional approval of congestion pricing, knowing that, in fact, the State had abandoned it. Is it your understanding that the State’s abandonment is temporary or permanent? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. We don’t know. That is up to the State. But what we know is we have certain responsibilities to process in- formation and approvals and permits unless we are formally noti- fied to do otherwise. So, the environmental assessment process con- tinued, but the next step would be for the State to sign on the VPPP agreement. That has not taken place yet. Mr. MOLINARO. So, is it some expectation that the—so, the State can now simply temporarily withhold signature indefinitely? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Effectively, yes, the State would either—— Mr. MOLINARO [interrupting]. ‘‘Yes,’’ it can be indefinite? Secretary BUTTIGIEG [continuing]. Proceed or would not proceed. Mr. MOLINARO. But it—so, it is your—but it is fair for the State simply to, having gone through this process, to now just abandon it entirely? They can do that? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. In terms of compliance with the environ- mental assessment, they have met their marks, and we have met ours. Mr. MOLINARO. How many Federal dollars do you think have been committed to assisting either in the environmental review stage or planning stage, or even capital to the implementation of congestion pricing in the city of New York? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. I can tell you it was a complex and thor- ough-going process. I am not sure I would be able to compute how many person-hours went into it. Mr. MOLINARO. I think it is important for the American tax- payers, the New York taxpayers, to know how much has already been committed and how much is going to be set aside because of the State’s abandonment. It is clear to most of us in New York—and again, I have my res- ervations about it to begin with—that the Governor of New York made a political decision. That political decision has now left the taxpayers of the State of New York with a fairly significant budget hole. And as it relates to the first line of questioning, it also leaves those who don’t have access to mass transportation and mass tran- sit in and around the city of New York still sitting on the sidelines. And I do think that the Department ought to take some punitive action to recapture those dollars and at least hold States like New York accountable for wasting them. I am out of time. But Mr. Secretary, I would appreciate some up- date on enforcement, at least as it relates to ADA compliance at Amtrak. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. I will try to get that to you. Mr. MOLINARO. I appreciate your time. Thank you. Ms. MALOY. The gentleman yields. Mrs. Peltola is recognized for 5 minutes. Mrs. PELTOLA. Thank you, Madam Chair. Good afternoon, Secretary Buttigieg. It is good to see you again. Before I start my questions I really want to thank you sincerely for VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00106 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6633 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN97 coming to Alaska in August. It was great to have you in our State, seeing our complex challenges and amazing opportunities. Alaska is enormous. If we were our own country, we would be the 18th largest country in the world. We are a very big State, and a lot of logistics and transportation issues are on the top of our mind. We are all really aware of when the next barge is coming in, when the next jet is coming in. So, I really want to thank you for all the work that you do. One of my top priorities, one of the top priorities for the Alaska delegation, is the FAA Reauthorization Act, and we worked really hard to get exemptions to the deadline for the low-lead avgas for Alaska. There are a number of issues. We wanted to get an exten- sion for Alaska into the FAA reauthorization. We have serious con- cerns about the pace of this proposed transition to potentially an inadequately proven alternative, its potential impacts on aviation safety in Alaska, as well as the logistical challenges for distributing a replacement fuel across Alaska and its many remote communities in terms of bulk fuel storage. Since you are here today, I just wanted to underscore my concern and ask you if you would be willing to commit to working with my office and my constituents on this important issue. Eighty-two per- cent of Alaska is only accessible by air, and about 75 percent of those communities don’t have a runway long enough for a jet or larger aircraft. So, that avgas is really important for Alaska’s avia- tion community, and I just wanted to acknowledge that now. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Thank you. You mentioned my recent visit to Alaska. And certainly, one of the things that you come away with is just being astonished by the scale of the State and the pro- portion of communities that don’t have road access where aviation is, literally, the only way to have access there. And so, we are very conscious that these general aviation aircraft are something that Alaska residents rely on for their basic daily needs. And you have my commitment that FAA’s work on this transition will take that into account, and I will certainly welcome opportunities to work with you on how best to live up to that commitment. Mrs. PELTOLA. OK, excellent. My second question is during the pandemic, there was a real na- tional awareness about the importance of onshoring critical min- erals. And this was discussed a little bit ago, particularly where rare earth minerals, which play a critical role in our modern econ- omy and national security—responsibly developing rare earth min- erals here at home in the United States and especially in Alaska is a priority of mine. However, along with what is an often extremely burdensome reg- ulatory process, which was also mentioned a little bit ago, trans- portation is one of the key challenges companies often encounter in getting resources from point A to point B, and I was hoping you would be able to talk a little bit about opportunities you see for rail to help advance the United States efforts to onshore or produce these rare earth minerals domestically. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Thank you. Yes, certainly, part of the ra- tionale for good rail investment is the relevance of those supply chains that are shifting. And if we want to make sure that more of the materials that we have increased demand for here in the VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00107 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6633 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN98 U.S. are sourced domestically, especially given these strategic and human rights concerns associated with some of the other countries vying to produce them, then we have got to make sure we have the infrastructure to support that process. And that is certainly part of what could qualify something, for example, to be convincing in an application for discretionary funding to improve rail assets. Mrs. PELTOLA. OK. Another topic, hot topic, has been electric cars. And there are communities in Alaska where it makes sense to have electric cars. I think Juneau is a really good example of high usage of electric cars. However, when the majority of our com- munities are creating electricity with diesel that we ship in by barge, it doesn’t make sense to be pushing electric cars. And it is also in communities where it is very cold and it is hard to keep a battery alive. So, my other request is that you keep outlier States like Alaska in mind when these blanket rules or proposed rules are issued. And lastly, I really want to thank you for your responsiveness. You helped Alaska a great deal with the Port of Alaska, the Port of Anchorage issue. Your MARAD folks were really accommodating, and I just appreciate the level of response that we get from you and your Department. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Well, thanks. And likewise, we appreciated the opportunity to work with you and your team on that. Mrs. PELTOLA. Thank you, Madam Chair. Ms. MALOY. The gentlewoman yields. Mr. Van Drew is recog- nized for 5 minutes. Dr. VAN DREW. Thanks for being here, Secretary. The Biden ad- ministration is aggressively pushing to industrialize the east coast, as you know, with offshore wind. As Secretary, you have facilitated over $200 million in Maritime Administration grants for wind ports. And honestly, few people support offshore wind as strongly as you do. I want to be clear: I support clean energy. I support solar energy. I support nuclear energy. They are safe, they are economically via- ble. And offshore wind, in my opinion, is neither. Offshore wind negatively impacts transportation safety under this committee’s ju- risdiction—and that is why I ask you about it, I am not asking you an energy question—including maritime navigation and aviation. Offshore wind interferes with radar systems. This includes mari- time navigation radar and air traffic radar. And this is not me just saying this. A recent study found that Mid-Atlantic wind farms interfere with 36 different land-based radar systems. This inter- ference diminishes safety at sea and in the air. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which you are very familiar with, de- termined that offshore wind increases—again, it is not me saying this, it is them—the risk of maritime collisions, the risk of injury, and even the risk of death at sea. Your own FAA is now reviewing the impact of offshore wind projects on major airports, including New York’s JFK Airport and, in my district, the Atlantic City Airport. In both cases, offshore wind interferes with airport flightpaths. Somehow, these projects have already been approved by the Federal Government, despite the aviation safety conflicts that exist. I have a simple question, and I appreciate a yes or a no.

Would that be—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [interrupting]. Well, the FAA will never permit an unsafe condition. Dr. VAN DREW. So, you would help to make sure that that was blocked? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. If there was no alternative, and it was going to be unsafe, then the FAA wouldn’t be able to support it. Dr. VAN DREW. I just wanted you on the record on that. In my opinion, these conflicts prove that safety evaluation is incomplete to this day, and that—and again, not just me saying—and that off- shore wind is moving ahead, in my sense, prematurely. The GAO office, the Government Accountability Office, is cur- rently conducting a comprehensive study of the impacts of offshore wind. We requested that. It includes a major focus on safety im- pacts. It looks at the environment, the economy, national security, utility costs, noise, natural disaster resilience, not all of which falls under your bailiwick, but some of it does. We must understand the breadth of the impacts of offshore wind. It is a permanent indus- trialization of our ocean. Should we wait—all I am asking here is for the GAO study to be completed. That is not a Republican study. It is not my study. It is the Government Accountability Office, totally nonpartisan. Shouldn’t we wait until their safety analysis is done before we go ahead and build offshore wind, yes or no? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. I can only weigh in on the transportation side of the house, but we will not proceed with anything we think harms safety. And if GAO or anybody else produced data or anal- ysis that would affect a safety decision about transportation, we would want to know it. Dr. VAN DREW. So, we are building those projects now. Shouldn’t we wait until they come back and say whether they are safe or un- safe? A purely objective, nonpolitical, nonpartisan viewpoint. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. As a general rule, we don’t terminate eco- nomic development because research is underway. But when re- search is completed, we include that in our future work. Dr. VAN DREW. Well, the shame of that is—and was alluded to before—if we go ahead and are in the middle of doing these projects and find that there are safety issues where they are being placed, now we have spent huge amounts—and I mean huge amounts—of taxpayer dollars, and we find out that we shouldn’t move forward. Either way, we are going to move forward, and it will be unsafe or we wouldn’t move forward and spent a ton of money that we shouldn’t have spent. And by the way, with offshore wind, everybody pays more. The Government, huge, multibillion-dollar subsidies. Taxpayers pay more for that reason. Families pay more because the utility rates are going to increase radically. See, the difference with solar panels is when you use solar panels, it decreases the cost to the family for their energy source. When you do wind, their costs and residential utility rates are going to go way up. These developers and—also are foreign countries. Now, all of that doesn’t fall under you.

But the safety issues do. They are enormously expensive, and the subsidies are great. Do you support—OK, I have a last question—do you support the offshore wind financing strategy of increasing utility rates? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. We support options for the American peo- ple when it comes to energy. Again, from a transportation perspec- tive, that is mostly making sure there is adequate port facilities. Dr. VAN DREW. I have more questions. I would like to ask unani- mous consent to put them in the record. Ms. MALOY. Where—— Dr. VAN DREW [interrupting]. No, I just want them in the record. Ms. MALOY. Without objection, without objection. Dr. VAN DREW. Thank you. Ms. MALOY. The gentleman yields. Mr. Van Orden is recognized for 5 minutes, but we have got 8 minutes to vote, so, keep it brisk. Mr. VAN ORDEN. Thank you, Madam Chair. Please pull up that image, get it on the screen. [Slide] Mr. VAN ORDEN. Here it is. We have done this before, Mr. Sec- retary. Are you aware that 70 percent of the world’s cobalt is produced in the Democratic Republic of the Congo? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Yes. Mr. VAN ORDEN. Are you aware that 4.3 percent of every electric car battery is comprised of cobalt? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. What I can tell you is that today’s EV bat- teries use 80 percent less cobalt and, in fact, most of the—— Mr. VAN ORDEN [interrupting]. Mr. Secretary, please—— Secretary BUTTIGIEG [continuing].

I am going to remind you of something that ap- parently you have forgotten. I am a member of a co-equal branch of Government, and will be respected, and you will not interrupt me in my house. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Then I would ask you not to interrupt me either, Congressman. Mr. VAN ORDEN. Very well. Are you aware that 4.3 percent of all electric batteries are comprised of cobalt? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Again, I don’t know the recency of that data, but I can tell you the cobalt composition is going down.

Are you aware that 15 to 30 per- cent of all of the cobalt mines in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are artesian mines? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. I believe you. Mr. VAN ORDEN. That is correct. Are you aware that approxi- mately 40 to 255,000 cobalt miners in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are children working in slave conditions? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. I am certainly aware of horrific conditions around the world in the extraction and mining industries of many minerals, including cobalt. Mr. VAN ORDEN. The last time you were here, I asked you a very specific question: How many of these children do you estimate will have to die to make the goal of electrifying 50 percent of the fleet by 2030 electric? This was your response: ‘‘We have better data on how many children will die if we allow climate change to increase unimpeded.’’ That tells me that you actually do have data on how many children will die from mining cobalt if you are able to tell me that you have more data on how many children will be dying from climate change. So, I would like an answer to my question: How many children are going to have to die in those conditions to meet the artificial goal of 2030 of electrifying half of the fleet? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. None, if you will work with us to make sure that anything imported is conforming to our requirements around forced and child labor. Mr. VAN ORDEN. Until that is able to take place, how many chil- dren are going to have to continue to work in slave conditions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to make sure that we can meet the artificial goal of 50 percent of the fleet being electrified by 2030? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. None is the only acceptable answer. Mr. VAN ORDEN. That is excellent. And guess what, sir? [Slide] Mr. VAN ORDEN. This is H.R. 8495, put in by my friend, Mr. Duarte from California. It is an EV fair trade bill. I am going to ask you publicly now, and I will send this to your office. If you will support this bill—you and me are six and seven. I know you got little kids. I have nine grandkids. I am going to have 11 by the end of the summer. I don’t ever want your children to be exposed to any of this. I don’t want my grandchildren to be exposed to any of this. And I don’t think you do, either, Mr. Secretary. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. If this legislation represents a serious ef- fort to ensure compliance with forced and child labor requirements and make sure that none of that finds its way into products used in America, then I would be very interested to work on that. Mr. VAN ORDEN. I will send it to you because it is laser-focused on that very specific issue. So, what I heard from this from you, Mr. Secretary, is that you do understand that there are children working in these horrific conditions, and we acknowledge this, and we acknowledge the fact that what is driving that—those condi- tions with these African children—and some of their folks are right across the way—what is driving these children, these African chil- dren, to work in slave conditions is our want and consumption of cobalt. That is factual. VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00111 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6633 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN102 Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Which is why we are trying to cut the use of cobalt, right? Because really, we have—in my view, we have four options: stop using batteries, have batteries that don’t use cobalt, source cobalt from somewhere that doesn’t have the conditions of the DRC, or have better conditions in the DRC. And I think it is a combination of the last three that is more realistic than stopping using batteries. Mr. VAN ORDEN. I understand that. So, we do know and we are acknowledging publicly that this is taking place, and that we can work collectively to stop this because this is terrible. And no one who has a soul can look at those pictures and say that having an artificial date of 2030 established for 50 percent of our fleet to be electrified is worth a single child working in slavery. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. No one here, to the best of my knowledge, accepts those kinds of conditions in any product. And I hope you are equally serious about the other 158 products that have been identified as being vulnerable to child or forced labor abroad. Mr. VAN ORDEN. Mr. Secretary, I am deadly serious about that, and I am amazed that you and I found common accord, and I ap- preciate it. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Wonders never cease, Congressman. Mr. VAN ORDEN. With that, I yield back. Secretary BUTTIGIEG. Thank you. Ms. MALOY. The gentleman yields. I recognize myself for one really quick minute. Mr. Secretary, this morning, in response to my colleague, Mr. Crawford, you said ‘‘Anything we do we think is a good allocation of taxpayer resources, otherwise we wouldn’t do it.’’ I am not sure I agree with that. But as a member of the legislative branch with the responsibility to control the purse strings, I want to help you make that more true. So, I want to just really quickly ask for your cooperation. My colleague, Ms. Chavez-DeRemer, talked about the FREE Act, and permit by rule, and how we could make these projects move faster. The first thing it does is ask the administration to identify places where permit by rule would be appropriate. Will you work with us on identifying some of those so that we can shorten up this time period and make it more cost effective for taxpayers? Secretary BUTTIGIEG. I would be happy to. Ms. MALOY. OK. Well, in that case, I yield back. Are there any further questions from any members of the committee who have not been recognized? Seeing none, that concludes our hearing for today. I would like to thank the witness for his testimony. The committee stands adjourned.

Rick Larsen Dear Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen: The Zero Emission Transportation Association (ZETA) is an industry-backed coali- tion of member companies spanning the entire electric vehicle (EV) supply chain, including vehicle manufacturers, charging infrastructure manufacturers and net- work operators, battery manufacturers and recyclers, electricity providers, and crit- ical minerals producers, among others. ZETA would like to thank the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure for the opportunity to submit a statement for the record for the hearing on the De- partment of Transportation’s FY 2025 budget request on June 27, 2024. In response, ZETA offers our perspective on some of the topics raised during the hearing. CURRENT AND FUTURE DEMAND TRENDS EV sales are at record highs, and are projected to grow even more in the coming years.1 The average price of a long-range EV recently fell below that of the average new vehicle in the United States, before any purchase incentives are included.2 EV technology and manufacturing capabilities are maturing rapidly and will drive down costs even further for consumers in the coming years. To incentivize greater domestic investment in this developing sector, the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act expanded certain tax credit eligibility for EV manu- facturers, among other recipients. The public-private partnerships supported by these federal investments have generated huge economic impacts, including $177 billion of private investment in the EV supply chain,3 approximately 200,000 esti- mated direct and 800,000 indirect jobs,4 and 408 new or expanded facilities.5 The continued growth of this industry will provide ongoing economic benefits to the United States and expanded employment opportunities over time. RECENT ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) REGULATIONS Operating under its longstanding authority under §202 of the Clean Air Act, EPA recently finalized new emissions standards for light, medium, and heavy-duty vehi- cles.6, 7 The standards will take effect beginning with Model Year 2027 new vehicles and will preserve consumer choice while significantly reducing tailpipe emissions. The final rules are not mandates to sell EVs but represent a technology-neutral effort to reduce tailpipe emissions on a fleetwide basis. Automakers can achieve emissions reductions through a combination of various technologies, including more efficient and lower-emission internal combustion engine (ICE) cars. Nothing in these regulations forces the purchase of any given technology or vehicle type. 1 ‘‘The Slowdown in US Electric Vehicle Sales Looks More Like a Blip,’’ Bloomberg, May 28, 2024, https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-28/the-slowdown-in-us-electric-vehicle- sales-looks-more-like-a-blip 2 ‘‘Long-Range EVs Now Cost Less Than the Average New Car in the US’’, Bloomberg, June 7, 2024, https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-07/long-range-evs-now-cost-less-than- the-average-us-new-car 3 ‘EV Jobs Hub.’ BlueGreen Alliance Foundation, (2024) https://evjobs.bgafoundation.org/ 4 Opening Statement for the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee ‘‘Hearing to Examine Federal Electric Vehicle Incentives Including the Government’s Role in Fostering Reli- able and Resilient Electric Vehicle Supply Chains,’’ U.S. Deputy Secretary of Treasury Adewale Adeyemo, (January 11, 2024) https://www.energy.senate.gov/services/files/AA567D87-DA99- 4E39-A97F-C02CA2BE6E93 5 ‘EV Jobs Hub.’ BlueGreen Alliance Foundation, (2024) https://evjobs.bgafoundation.org/ 6 89 Fed.

These rules also support the supply chain’s ability to smoothly scale and remain globally competitive. After thorough en- gagement with industry and other stakeholders, the publication of the final rules was met with overwhelming support across the automotive industry, including the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, GM, Ford, and Stellantis, who recognized that the rules respect consumer choice. RESPONSIBLY-SOURCED SUPPLY CHAINS ZETA shares the Committee’s deep concerns about the use of unethical labor prac- tices in the mining of certain battery materials, including cobalt, in foreign nations such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The problem of so-called ‘‘con- flict minerals’’ and their use across advanced technological sectors is a complex one, and the EV industry is working rapidly to do its part, building up fully sustainable and responsibly sourced supply chains as quickly as possible. Automakers are in- tently focused on scaling up production in the U.S. and allied nations, as well as innovating on battery technology to minimize percentages of conflict minerals. While the presence of forced labor in U.S. supply chains is guarded against by existing statutes—such as the Section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. § 1307), the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2005 (Public Law 109–317), and the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (Public Law No. 117–78)— there is more work to be done. In order to further reduce the risk of unethical labor practices abroad as much as possible, ZETA urges Congress to consider ways to sup- port domestic mining of battery minerals, which would not only decrease reliance on opaque supply chains, but also create mining jobs at home. EVS AND THE HIGHWAY TRUST FUND (HTF) It is critical to note that HTF shortfalls are due in large part to longstanding pol- icy decisions that predate the recent wide-scale deployment of EVs, including a lack of updates to the gas tax, even index for inflation, since 1992. Discussions around sustainable support for the HTF must be part of a nuanced approach to the long- term solvency of the HTF. We urge the Committee to consider any future changes to the funding structure of the HTF in a holistic, thoughtful, and fair manner. FIRE SAFETY Safety is paramount as more lithium-ion batteries enter the marketplace. While concerns have been raised regarding the perceived risk of ignition and explosion, EV fires are rare—in fact, observational data examined by the National Transportation Safety Board found that EVs are less likely to catch fire than ICE vehicles.8 As a result, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has stated that it ‘‘does not believe that electric vehicles present a greater risk of post-crash fire than gasoline-powered vehicles.’’ All EVs must meet the same Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) used by gas-powered vehicles. In addition, the EV industry has adopted extensive safety and testing standards to better test and scrutinize battery products, ensuring that they are adequately designed to shut down when a collision or short circuit is detected. As part of its ongoing work to protect the safety of drivers, NHTSA re- cently sought feedback on its proposal to update FMVSS battery testing standards.9 f 8 ‘‘Safety Risks to Emergency Responders from Lithium-Ion Battery Fires in Electric Vehicles,’’ National Transportation Safety Board, November 13, 2020. https://www.ntsb.gov/safety/safety- studies/Documents/SR2001.pdf 9 89 Fed.

The Honorable RICK LARSEN, Ranking Member, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC 20515. DEAR CHAIR GRAVES AND RANKING MEMBER LARSEN: We respectfully request that this letter be considered during tomorrow’s Com- mittee hearing, Oversight of the Department of Transportation’s Policies and Pro- grams and Fiscal Year 2025 Budget Request. Eliminating the preventable physical, emotional, and economic toll of motor vehicle crashes is a commitment shared by our organizations. To accomplish this safety priority, adequate resources for the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and its agencies, including funds and staff for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA, ‘‘Agency’’), are vital. According to NHTSA, traffic fatalities and injuries remain at historically high lev- els. In 2022, an average of 116 people were killed every day on roads in the U.S., totaling just over 42,500 fatalities.i An additional 2.38 million people were injured.ii This is a 29 percent increase in deaths in just a decade.iii Early projections for 2023 traffic fatalities remain at a similar level; nearly 41,000 people are estimated to have died that year.iv Approximately 7,522 pedestrians and 1,105 bicyclists were killed in 2022, representing a one percent and 13 percent increase respectively, from 2021.v In 2022, 6,218 motorcyclists were killed, accounting for 15 percent of all traf- fic fatalities.vi This is the highest number of motorcyclists killed since at least 1975.vii Additionally, in 2022, nearly 6,000 people were killed in crashes involving a large truck.viii Since 2009, the number of fatalities in large truck involved crashes has increased by 76 percent.ix More than 160,600 people were injured in crashes in- volving a large truck in 2022, a nearly four percent increase over 2021.x Several leading behavioral issues continue to be leading factors in traffic fatalities including alcohol-impairment, speeding and lack of restraint use.xi Driver distrac- tion is also known to be a principal cause of motor vehicle crashes.xii In 2022, alco- hol-involved crashes claimed the lives of 13,524 people, speeding-related traffic crashes killed 12,151 people, and 11,302 people killed in crashes did not buckle up, i Overview of Motor Vehicle Traffic Crashes in 2022, NHTSA, Apr. 2024, DOT HS 813 560.

These issues are persistent, and the solutions are known and available, yet remain underused, underfunded or are not required as standard equipment in vehicles. Roadway crashes also impose a tremendous cost burden on society. In 2019, crashes, injuries, and fatalities imposed a financial burden of nearly $1.4 trillion in total costs to society—$340 billion of which are direct economic costs, equivalent to a ‘‘crash tax’’ of $1,035 on every person living in the U.S.xvi Distracted driving crashes accounted for $98 billion of the economic costs.xvii In 2018, crashes alone cost employers $72.2 billion.xviii When adjusted solely for inflation, the amount is nearly $90 billion in 2024 Sufficient funding and resources for NHTSA can be the catalyst for implementing effective safety countermeasures to prevent crashes, save lives, reduce injuries, and contain costs. While traffic fatalities continue to be a public health crisis, the funding for NHTSA’s lifesaving mission has fallen woefully short for more than four decades as costs and statutory responsibilities have increased. While 95 percent of transpor- tation-related fatalities involve motor vehicles, NHTSA historically receives only one percent of the overall U.S. DOT budget.xix Despite persistently high crash deaths and injuries, increasingly complex vehicle technology and related issues, consist- ently high numbers of vehicle safety recalls, overdue motor vehicle and motor car- rier safety rules mandated by Congress, and more requirements, the NHTSA’s ac- tual spending for vehicle safety programs has dramatically declined based on infla- tion, as illustrated by the chart below. xiii National Center for Statistics and Analysis.

We were pleased that the recently enacted Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024 (Pub. L. 118–42) fully funded the safety improvements in the bipartisan Infrastruc- ture Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA, Pub. L. 117–58) including for roadway infra- structure improvements consistent with the Safe System Approach (SSA) which are shown to prevent or mitigate crashes and interactions between road users. Further, we are encouraged by the Administration’s FY 2025 budget proposal for the U.S. DOT which provides an $82.6 million increase in funding for NHTSA.xxii This boost will help the agency address the shortfall in spending power detailed in the chart above and serve as a good ‘‘down payment’’ on the Agency’s work related to vehicle safety rulemaking, enforcement, research and analysis which has a high payoff. As we elapse the halfway point between the enactment of the IIJA and the end of its five-year span, a majority of the directives to NHTSA to establish performance standards for critical vehicle safety technology are overdue or unfulfilled. Moreover, the Agency is responsible for a range of initiatives aimed at reducing risky driving decisions such as speeding, and distracted, drunk, drugged, and drowsy driving, im- proving occupant protection, and bolstering the safety of vulnerable road users, among others. The Section 402 Highway Safety Program and Section 405 National Priority Safety Program, in combination with state adoption of essential traffic safe- ty laws, can assist these ongoing efforts. Additionally, the Agency’s Operations and Research (O&R) budget is crucial to important activities related to data collection, consumer information, and identification of vehicle safety defects. All these safety objectives can and should be realized by an adequately funded budget. Our nation is at a transformative time in transportation with the rapid develop- ment and deployment of lifesaving vehicle safety technologies.

PETE BUTTIGIEG, SECRETARY OF TRANSPOR- TATION, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, FROM HON. SAM GRAVES Question 1. Secretary Buttigieg, Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) drone oper- ations present numerous operational and economic advantages. In the drone deliv- ery space, BVLOS operations offer a cost-effective alternative to traditional delivery methods, most notably in their ability to expedite transportation of both consumer goods and medical materials. These benefits promise to drive economic growth and innovation, expand connectivity, and keep America at the forefront of a rapidly evolving global drone market. Can you commit to prioritizing the BVLOS rulemaking to meet the statutory deadlines set forth in Section 930 of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024? ANSWER. The FAA is working to publish the notice of proposed rulemaking, ‘‘Nor- malizing Unmanned Aircraft Systems Beyond Visual Line of Sight Operations,’’ which is expected to expedite the introduction of BVLOS operations In the mean- time, the FAA has streamlined approval processes for BVLOS operations approved through waivers or exemptions and is working to exercise the flexibility provided in the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024 to enable more scalable BVLOS operations in advance of rulemaking. QUESTIONS TO HON. PETE BUTTIGIEG, SECRETARY OF TRANSPOR- TATION, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, FROM HON. ERIC A. ‘‘RICK’’ CRAWFORD Question 1. 49 U.S.C. 5323(r) states that recipients of Federal transit financial as- sistance ‘‘may not deny reasonable access for a private intercity or charter transpor- tation operator to Federally funded public transportation facilities.’’ Earlier this year, a representative of the American Bus Association shared that noncompliance with this provision is widespread, and that many bus operators across the country are being denied access to intermodal facilities that receive funds from your Depart- ment.1 Question 1.a. What is being done to ensure that this rule is being followed? And how does DOT enforce this law and resolve disagreements between Federal grant award recipients and private bus operators? ANSWER. A limited number of situations over the past year have been brought to the agency’s attention through intercity or charter operators. Upon receiving such a concern, FTA’s first step is to engage with the recipient to ensure the recipient has analyzed whether the facility has capacity to accommodate the private pro- viders, which is stipulated in the statute; the law requires accommodation only if there is capacity. FTA generally does not intervene in local decisions about the re- cipient’s use of a facility and/or determination if there is extra space to allow a pri- vate provider to use the facility. Rather, FTA attempts to facilitate resolution be- tween recipients and private providers. Question 1.b. Does DOT have a process in place to monitor or record instances of access to Federally funded transit facilities being delayed, denied, or otherwise offered under unreasonable conditions to private bus operators? 1 Rural Transportation Challenges: Stakeholder Perspectives before the Subcomm. on Highways and Transit of the H.

In the few instances where FTA has received complaints about a denial of access, FTA has engaged with the recipients to understand the basis for the de- nial. Question 2. 49 U.S.C. 5323(d), Condition on Charter Bus Service, prevents public transit agencies from providing charter trips outside their regularly scheduled serv- ices in competition with private motorcoach operators.2 This provision was initially codified in law as part of the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964 (P.L.88–364).3 On June 10, 2024, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) issued a Dear Col- league letter to transit agencies across the country providing ‘‘advice, reminders, and considerations to keep in mind’’ in preparation for the upcoming 2026 World Cup and 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games, both being held in the United States.4 While acknowledging that transit agencies must abide by the aforemen- tioned charter regulations, the document included various suggestions about how public transit agencies could serve these large events without involving the private sector. Is the FTA fully committed to enforcing the provisions in 49 U.S.C. 5323(d) that have been law for half a century? ANSWER. Yes. Question 2.a. Does FTA intend to provide additional regulatory guidance, or ‘‘ad- vice, reminders, and considerations,’’ related to the charter bus service rules in prep- aration for other large scale national events? ANSWER. The FTA is always prepared to provide additional guidance to its recipi- ents as necessary. The most recent Dear Colleague letter, dated June 10, 2024, is just one example of FTA’s proactive efforts to provide guidance in many different areas as needed. Question 2.b. Is FTA considering changes to the way that the charter bus service rules are presently being enforced or have been enforced for the preceding fifty years? ANSWER. FTA’s charter rule is currently scheduled for review and administrative changes on the Unified Agenda, but FTA is not considering any changes regarding how the charter rule has been enforced since its last substantive change in 2008. Question 3. In June, Coach USA, the largest privately owned bus company in the United States, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.5 Greyhound Lines, the largest inter- city bus service in North America, has terminated routes or otherwise cut back serv- ice in major cities across the United States in recent months in order to decrease costs.6 Private bus service, especially those that serve smaller and rural areas, is a vital part of the national transportation network. What is your current assessment of the commercial bus industry and is the Department considering policies or efforts to sustain this mode of public transportation? ANSWER. FTA agrees that intercity bus service provides a critical connection for people in rural and urban areas alike to the services and places that are important to them. FTA is able to support the intercity bus industry through its grant pro- grams. Intermodal facilities that serve intercity bus are eligible under the Buses and Bus Facilities competitive grant program as long as those facilities also serve public transportation. FTA’s Formula Grants for Rural Areas program requires that a state provide 15% of their rural formula funds for intercity bus projects unless they certify that the intercity bus needs of the state have been met, which means that in FY24 around $140 million was available from that program for intercity bus projects. Question 4. Last fall, the Subcommittee on Highways and Transit held a hearing on ‘‘The Future of Automated Commercial Motor Vehicles: Impacts on Society, the Supply Chain, and U.S. Economic Leadership.’’ Testimony was received on efforts the autonomous vehicle trucking sector is taking to improve safety on our roadways. In preparation for deployment, the AV trucking industry has developed a flashing 2 49 U.S.C. § 5323. 3 Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964, Pub. L.

This light-based system would provide immediate and effective notice to approaching motorists, and studies found it to be equally or more effective in ena- bling road users to recognize and react to the stopped truck when compared to tradi- tional warning devices. Under FMCSA’s regulations (49 CFR 381.320), the agency attempts to make a de- cision on applications within six months, yet this narrow exemption application for the AV trucking industry has been pending for 17 months.7 On June 26, 2024, in response to a question for the record submitted after my subcommittee’s December 13, 2023, hearing, the FMCSA stated that it is ‘‘currently reviewing and considering numerous public comments received in response to the Federal Register notice.’’ Considering the amount of time that has passed compared to the typical timeline, what is the reason for the delay on this petition? Please also provide the committee a specific timeline in which you expect to issue a decision. ANSWER. Petitions of a complex or novel nature sometimes require additional in- ternal consultation and time to thoroughly review and consider the petition, the comments submitted, and whether the exemption, if granted, would likely achieve a level of safety equivalent to, or greater than, the level of safety achieved by the regulation. On March 3, 2023, FMCSA published a Federal Register notice, 88 FR 13489 (clarified, and comment period extended, March 9, 2023, 88 FR 14665) an- nouncing that it received an application from Waymo LLC, and Aurora Operations, Inc. for a 5-year exemption from the warning device placement requirements of 49 CFR 392.22(b) and use of a warning device that does not meet the steady-burning lamp requirement of 49 CFR 393.25(e). The exemption seeks to allow all motor car- riers that operate Level 4 autonomous commercial motor vehicles (CMV) to use a warning device for stopped vehicles that is not currently authorized in 49 CFR 393.95(f). The Secretary of Transportation may only grant an exemption from a regulation if the Secretary finds such exemption would likely achieve a level of safety that is equivalent to, or greater than, the level that would be achieved absent such exemp- tion. FMCSA has completed its review of the exemption application, the public com- ments, and cited documentation submitted in response to the Federal Register no- tice. The Agency continues to diligently work through its analysis and final written decision on the exemption application. Question 5. I appreciate the productive discussion regarding the Department’s au- thority to ensure that the testing for safety sensitive transportation positions will continue, regardless of the Administration’s proposal to reclassify marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III. I appreciate your stating: ‘‘Our commitment to testing continues regardless of the schedule . . . we be- lieve our authorities are intact because they don’t call for testing by ref- erence to where marijuana sits in its classification. So whether we’re talk- ing about the regulated community—truck drivers—or our own personnel, such as an air traffic controller, our understanding is that nothing about that reclassification would change.’’ Please share with the Committee the basis for that understanding. ANSWER. The basis for the Department’s understanding is the Omnibus Transpor- tation Employee Testing Act of 1991, which gives the Secretary the authority to test for any controlled substance under section 102(6) of the Controlled Substance Act (21 U.S.C. 802(6)) whose use the Secretary has determined has a risk to transpor- tation safety. Question 6. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is key to DOT’s ability to conduct drug testing of its own employees and to regulate safety- sensitive employees in the transportation industries. What steps has the DOT taken to coordinate with HHS regarding the potential rescheduling of marijuana to Sched- ule III and its impact on the HHS-certified laboratories that conduct marijuana drug testing on both the DOT-regulated public and DOT’s own employees? ANSWER. DOT has actively engaged with HHS and the White House regarding the impact of rescheduling on DOT’s drug testing programs. These discussions are ongo- ing, and DOT will provide a more detailed response after these discussions conclude. 7 Parts and Accessories Necessary for Safe Operation; Exemption Application From Waymo LLC, and Aurora Operations, Inc., 88 Fed.

PETE BUTTIGIEG, SECRETARY OF TRANSPOR- TATION, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, FROM HON. SCOTT PERRY Question 1. The Lancaster Airport (LNS) announced it will begin offering non-stop flights to Orlando beginning on October 8, 2024. Will this expansion in service re- sult in LNS losing its essential air service subsidies? ANSWER. No. Air service currently operating from Lancaster Airport (LNS) to Or- lando International Airport (MCO) does not satisfy the community’s essential air service (EAS) requirements per federal law, so Lancaster airport’s existing EAS sub- sidies are not impacted. Under 49 U.S.C. § 41732, ‘‘basic EAS’’ requires, among other things, two daily round trips, 6 days a week (12 round trips per week) to a medium or large hub airport less than 650 miles from the eligible place. As an- nounced by Breeze Airways, the air carrier will offer only two round trips per week between LNS and MCO, and the distance from LNS to MCO is 855 miles. Accord- ingly, the service will not meet the basic EAS requirements related to frequencies or distance to the hub airport. QUESTIONS TO HON. PETE BUTTIGIEG, SECRETARY OF TRANSPOR- TATION, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, FROM HON. GAR- RET GRAVES Question 1. Section 912 of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024 requires the Of- fice of the Secretary to, not later than 270 days after enactment, establish a Depart- ment of Transportation program to provide competitive grants to state, local and tribal governments to use small drones to help address the backlog in critical infra- structure inspections in the United States. This language enjoyed bipartisan support in both the House and Senate and will help make critical infrastructure inspections safer for workers and more efficient for the users of the critical infrastructure. What steps has the USDOT taken to establish the Drone Infrastructure Inspection Grant (DIIG) program and will you commit to this Committee to meet or exceed the statu- tory deadline to establish the DIIG program? ANSWER. Infrastructure inspection using safe and reliable, domestically produced drones presents a way to better ensure the safety and stability of the national infra- structure and to enable economic benefits of drones. These inspections can and do happen across the country today under 14 CFR Part 107 line of sight operations. Even the Department uses drones to inspect critical highway infrastructure. The Department appreciates Congress’ support in developing this capability through pro- visions in the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024 (Pub. L. 118–63, May 16, 2024) that would enable the FAA to inspect its own infrastructure and manage a grant pro- gram for state governments to establish their own drone inspection programs. While this new program introduces important requirements, it has not yet received appro- priations sufficient to fully implement them. We look forward to collaborating with Congress to ensure that adequate funding is secured for all new programs mandated by the Reauthorization. The Department is fully committed to meeting the legisla- tive requirements for this and all provisions of the FAA Reauthorization. We are currently developing a management strategy that will allow us to implement the in- frastructure inspection program to the best of our ability, despite competing prior- ities and financial constraints. Question 2. The absence of a unified framework for BVLOS operations in the U.S. is stalling the growth of the domestic drone industry. Despite recommendations from an expert committee over two years ago, urging the FAA to establish regula- tions for safe BVLOS operations, no draft rule has been issued. The FAA Reauthor- ization Act, passed with broad bipartisan support, requires the FAA to propose its draft BVLOS rule by September. Considering the prolonged delay, what actions are the DOT and FAA taking to meet this deadline and provide a draft rule by Sep- tember 15th? ANSWER. The FAA is working to publish the notice of proposed rulemaking, ‘‘Nor- malizing Unmanned Aircraft Systems Beyond Visual Line of Sight Operations,’’ which is expected to expedite the introduction of BVLOS operations. In the mean- time, the FAA has streamlined approval processes for BVLOS operations approved through waivers or exemptions and is working to exercise the flexibility provided in the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024 to enable more scalable BVLOS operations in advance of rulemaking.

Mr. Secretary, you have a responsibility in ensuring MARAD admin- isters the Deepwater Port Act program, which authorizes permits for ports from which to export LNG to our allies but MARAD has failed to meet statutory dead- lines) and notices imposed by last year’s NDAA. Additionally, DOT has not held any regular or any in-person meetings with applicants so that they can possibly under- stand the agency’s concerns. It is a mistake for MARAD to delay approval for port applications over a misguided position that the Administration’s moratorium on LNG export means they cannot approve port applications. Secretary Granholm has indicated that a moratorium will be short-lived and ‘‘in the rearview mirror’’ by next year. Congress’ interest in this provision is clear—so what is the problem? ANSWER. MARAD has conducted timely approvals as part of the deepwater port application process. Processing a Deepwater Port License involves coordination among multiple state and federal agencies, and MARAD and all of these agencies strive to meet all established statutory timeframes. MARAD meets regularly with applicants who have an application under review when it is appropriate and per- taining to the deepwater port license application. Applicants who have questions about the environmental review portion of the application may also schedule a meet- ing with the U.S. Coast Guard. This step within the process involves the explicit engagement of resources to perform this phase of the licensing process. The environ- mental review is one of the most critical and technical parts of the processing of the deepwater application. The Deepwater Port Act at 33 U.S. Code § 1503 (c)(3) lists the conditions for issuance of a deepwater port license where a national inter- est determination is made independent of any determination by the Department of Energy. Question 4. The recently enacted FAA Reauthorization Act increased the author- ized funding level for FAA’s workforce grant programs for pilots and maintenance technicians from $15,000,000 to $20,000,000 per year. Congress has been providing funding for these grants since Fiscal Year 2022. Given the significant pilot work- force shortage in the United States, how does DOT plan to engage other federal agencies and key industry stakeholders to ensure that there is an adequate pipeline of young men and women seeking these professional positions in aviation? ANSWER. The FAA is performing outreach for the Aviation Workforce Develop- ment grant program. This outreach provides information to key stakeholders and in- dustry on the overall grant program. The 2024 FAA Reauthorization expanded the eligible applicant pool to include 501(c)(3) organizations and Tribal and territorial governments. The FAA is providing technical assistance to educate applicants on the application process to improve the quality of applications that consist of grass- roots initiatives and projects that create pipelines for young people to pursue avia- tion careers. Consideration may be given to applicants who would serve populations that are underrepresented in the aviation industry, including in economically dis- advantaged geographic areas and rural communities, address the workforce needs of rural and regional airports, and aviation programs at a minority serving institu- tion. Question 5. One of the emerging innovations in aviation is growth of the advanced air mobility industry—utilizing electric vehicle takeoff and landing aircraft to move people and cargo from point to point in urban and rural settings. The FAA Reau- thorization Act extended the Advanced Air Mobility Infrastructure pilot until 2026. How soon will we see eVTOL aircraft operating in the National Airspace System transporting people and cargo to key communities? What are the most promising applications for these aircraft? What changes or additions to the FAA’s workforce will be needed to manage these aircraft in the NAS? ANSWER. The FAA is actively working with several companies to review and es- tablish certification requirements for several powered-lift models, some of which are eVTOL aircraft. On March 8, 2024, the FAA published the final special class air- worthiness criteria for the Joby Model JAS4–1 powered-lift aircraft, and on May 24, 2024, the FAA published the final special class airworthiness criteria for the Archer Model M0001 powered-lift aircraft. In order to mitigate safety gaps that exist due to the absence of operational regu- lations specifically applicable to powered-lift, in October 2024, the FAA published an advance copy of a final Special Federal Aviation Regulation, ‘‘Integration of Pow- ered Lift: Pilot Certification and Operations; Miscellaneous Amendments Related to Rotorcraft and Airplanes.’’ This final rule will be published in the Federal Register in November 2024 and provides alternate eligibility requirements to safely certifi- cate initial groups of powered-lift pilots, and identifies the operating rules that apply to powered-lift on a temporary basis. The most promising applications will be the transportation of people and cargo in addition to the future potential for the transportation of medical supplies.

Future use cases for AAM include more dynamic emergency response capabili- ties, rapid transportation of goods from cargo terminals, on demand shuttle services better connecting urban areas to large airports, and regional air service to areas without existing rapid or reliable transportation links. The FAA is working through its research and development labs along with indus- try applicants to understand what changes to the workforce are needed to manage these aircraft. Question 6. Secretary Buttigieg, as AAM aircraft get certified for operation, it is critical that the FAA establish a clear, achievable path for civilians to acquire a powered-lift certificate. How is DOT coordinating with the FAA to ensure the nec- essary pilot rules are in place to establish an AAM pilot workforce? ANSWER. In October 2024, the FAA published the Notice of an advance copy of a final Special Federal Aviation Regulation, ‘‘Integration of Powered-Lift: Pilot Cer- tification and Operations; Miscellaneous Amendments Related to Rotorcraft and Air- planes’’. In this final rule which will be published in the Federal Register in Novem- ber 2024, the FAA provides alternate eligibility requirements to safely certificate initial groups of powered-lift pilots, as well as determine which operating rules to apply to powered-lift aircraft on a temporary basis to enable the FAA to gather ad- ditional information and determine the most appropriate permanent rulemaking path for these aircraft. Although the FAA has existing regulations in 14 CFR Part 61 for training and certificating powered-lift flight instructors and pilots, those regulations do not ade- quately address the unique challenges of introducing a new category of aircraft to civil operations. To maintain a level of safety commensurate with that expected for airplanes and helicopters, the FAA has finalized new requirements for pilots to hold type ratings for each powered-lift they fly and also finalized qualification require- ments for powered-lift pilots serving in 14 CFR Part 135. To address the obstacles to airman certification in existing regulations, the FAA proposed alternatives to cer- tain requirements in Part 61 to facilitate the training and certification of the initial cadre of powered-lift instructors and powered-lift pilots. Question 7. Part 121 and Part 135 air carriers are legally required to meet a stat- utory definition of being a ‘‘citizen of the United States’’ (49 U.S.C. § 40102(a)(15)) to limit foreign ownership and control over this critical American industry. What re- sources does the Department devote to enforcing compliance with the U.S. citizen- ship requirement for air carriers? What can the Committee and the aviation indus- try expect as to how swiftly and aggressively the Department will investigate cred- ible allegations that an air carrier is operating in violation of the U.S. citizenship requirement? What can the Committee and the aviation industry expect as to what enforcement tools the Department will use to stop an air carrier that the Depart- ment has determined is operating in violation of the U.S. citizenship requirement? ANSWER. The Department is committed to ensuring air carriers comply with U.S. citizenship requirements. For new applicants, the Department reviews applications for compliance before granting economic authority. For existing carriers, it conducts detailed reviews upon complaints or during fitness evaluations. If a carrier fails to meet citizenship requirements, the Department may suspend, revoke, or modify its certificates or impose penalties. The Department uses various tools, including inves- tigations and penalties, to address compliance issues. QUESTIONS TO HON. PETE BUTTIGIEG, SECRETARY OF TRANSPOR- TATION, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, FROM HON. JENNIFFER GONZÁLEZ-COLÓN Question 1. Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for your call yesterday and your well wish- es, and I would like to take this opportunity to draw your attention to issues in Puerto Rico transportation and ask questions related to projects located in Puerto Rico. Late last week, my office received notice of the approval of over $21 million for the Wharf D Reconstruction and Resiliency Project in San Juan through the RAISE Program. I understand these funds will be used for much needed activities in the Puerto Nuevo Docks, promoting economic activity at our ports. This is a very welcome announcement, and I would like to make sure we all understand the next VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00124 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN115 steps. Could you please inform us what are those next steps and the anticipated completion date of the project? ANSWER. In July 2024, the Department hosted a welcome webinar for all FY 2024 RAISE grant recipients and emailed each recipient their partially prepopulated grant agreement. The next step is for the Port Authority of Puerto Rico to fulfill federal requirements prior to executing the grant agreement. The Port Authority has estimated construction would begin in July 2025 and be completed in June 2027. Question 2. Related also to ports, I’d like to take the opportunity to request that the Department consider supporting more safety related projects, such as the fire suppression infrastructure at the Port of San Juan which currently does not meet Coast Guard standards due to inadequate water pressure. Requiring the port users to fund these types of projects means such costs get passed onto the people and com- munities of Puerto Rico. These types of safety related projects are infrastructure im- provements and should be given more consideration in programs like the Port Infra- structure Development Program. ANSWER. The extent to which a project advances safety is an important part of the statutory criteria reviewers consider when evaluating each project. In the past, we have awarded funding to projects that advance this key criterion, including projects in Puerto Rico. Most recently, for example, the Port Authority of Puerto Rico received a RAISE grant for its Wharf C Reconstruction and Resiliency En- hancement Project. This $25 million award funds needed improvements to Wharf C, including replacing the wharf’s concrete platform and making related utility im- provements, including rehabilitating the port’s existing fire protection system. Question 3. Secretary Buttigieg, as you know, Puerto Rico has two non-contiguous island municipalities on the Eastern coast of the main Island, Vieques and Culebra, with a combined population of close to 10,000 inhabitants. In addition to residents, both municipalities host students and employees who travel to and from Vieques and Culebra to work. They all share the need for reliable and efficient ferry serv- ices. Recently, the Puerto Rico government announced their plans to improve services using federal dollars to design and purchase 4 new vessels and build a new ferry terminal in Vieques. I would like to emphasize the importance of completing this work. Could you please provide us a status of these projects and when do you antici- pate their completion? ANSWER. Following the sinking of the passenger vessel Culebra II after Hurricane Irma, the FTA awarded Emergency Relief funding of $23,035,000 in fiscal year (FY) 2020 for the acquisition of a new passenger vessel with cargo capabilities. This im- provement was directly in response to the needs of the citizens of Vieques and Culebra. The new vessel is in the final phase of construction, currently in the water for testing, and its construction is expected to be completed in December 2024 or earlier. Additionally, the FTA is in the process of approving two grants totaling $44 mil- lion to fund three more cargo-passenger vessels for the Maritime Transport Author- ity (MTA)’s Island Service to the two non-contiguous island municipalities. These vessels are also under construction; two of them are expected to be completed by 2025, and the completion of the third vessel is expected in early 2026. Further projects are underway to rehabilitate the Mosquito Ferry Terminal in Vieques. Funds for this project and the additional vessels have been programmed through the Puerto Rican Statewide Transportation Improvement Program (STIP). We are assisting MTA in developing their grant applications. Question 4. Mr. Secretary, the Integrated Transportation Authority in Puerto Rico is currently undergoing a payment modernization project that will change how transportation fees are collected for popular public transportation modes, including Tren Urbano and our network of buses known as AMA. I understand the transition could take up to 6 months total and cost about $20 million in federal funds. Could you please provide us with the status of this project and when do you anticipate completion? ANSWER. The Puerto Rico Highway and Transportation Authority (PRHTA) is in the process of implementing a modernized Automatic Fare Collection (AFC) System for the Tren Urbano (TU) heavy rail system, bus systems [including Metropolitan Bus Authority (MBA), Metrobus, Tu Conexión, and Metro Urbano], and Metro-Ferry system. The modernized AFC system includes modern gates, ticket vending ma- chines (TVMs), and alternative payment methods such as debit, credit, and mobile application payment, among other improvements. Federal investment is approxi- mately twenty-two million dollars ($22M), distributed among six (6) FTA awards.

As of August 29, the overall project status is: • TU system gates and TVM installation at approximately 98%. • Routers and validators are installed on approximately 99% of buses. Cash-only operation to commence in late August 2024. • PRHTA is working with the AFC system vendor and third-party ferry system operator to integrate the respective fare systems. • PRHTA continues to negotiate with a qualified merchant processor and obtain banking industry certification for payment processing. Completion is expected within the next 60 days. • Equity analysis associated with the changes in fare collection method was com- pleted on May 31, 2024. • After December 2024, PRHTA expects to continue public outreach with ‘‘hands- on’’ demonstrations and educational material distribution, among other efforts. • The project ‘‘ribbon cutting’’ is expected on December 18, 2024. Question 5. Secretary Buttigieg, as you know, Puerto Rico residents rely on DOT field offices for technical assistance and other tasks to receive approval or funding for their projects. Can you please share with us a breakdown of staffing levels for DOT in PR, including any vacancies and what are the Department’s plans to fill these vacancies? ANSWER. DOT has 246 permanent federal employees located in Puerto Rico. As of June 2024, DOT has 12 vacancies (technicians, civil engineers, and safety inspec- tors) in Puerto Rico with plans to use on-the-spot hiring authority and/or tailored recruitment activities to fill the positions. In addition, relocation incentives will be used for individuals willing to locate to Puerto Rico. Question 6. Congress and the Administration have enabled special considerations to take into account empowerment zones and strategic seaports that apply for fed- eral grant awards. While these considerations have helped increase the competitive- ness for ports in Puerto Rico, Alaska, and Hawaii, I’d like to request you consider ways to further address the needs of ports in these non-contiguous areas that pro- vide such essential services. ANSWER. The Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) announcing the availability of discretionary grant funding for the FY 2024 Port Infrastructure Development Pro- gram includes a number of provisions that help address the needs of ports in non- contiguous states and territories. For example, as provided for in Section 3513 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024, large projects in non- contiguous states and territories do not need to meet the cost effectiveness deter- mination that applies to similarly-sized projects in the continental United States. Small projects in non-contiguous states and territories are also exempt from this re- quirement because of a further statutory provision. In addition, the NOFO asks ap- plicants to identify whether their projects are in Historically Disadvantaged Com- munities, a designation that, based on the results of previous application cycles, ap- plies to the vast majority of projects submitted by ports in Puerto Rico, Alaska, and Hawaii. Finally, we are hosting or engaging in focused outreach activities to im- prove the competitiveness of applications received from ports in Puerto Rico, Alaska, and Hawaii. On November 15, 2024, the Maritime Administration announced its FY24 Port Infrastructure Development Grants and Puerto Rico Ports Authority re- ceived a grant totaling $53,526,756. QUESTIONS TO HON. PETE BUTTIGIEG, SECRETARY OF TRANSPOR- TATION, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, FROM HON. DUSTY JOHNSON Question 1. Secretary Buttigieg, it is critical as a country that we ensure that tax- payer dollars are not spent on technology manufactured by Chinese military compa- nies or introduces cybersecurity risks to our critical infrastructure. One such tech- nology of concern is Chinese light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors, which col- lect real-time 3–D measurements of U.S. critical infrastructure, geography, and human behaviors. Chinese LiDAR is increasingly installed across our transportation infrastructure to automate traffic lights, monitor crowd flows at major transit hubs, control drawbridges, and more. In January 2024, the Department of Defense named the leading Chinese LiDAR manufacturer [https://media.defense.gov/2024/Jan/31/2003384819/-1/-1/0/1260H- LIST.PDF], Hesai, a ‘‘Chinese Military Company’’ operating in the United States.

This is similar to the playbook we saw with drones— creating an unfair playing field that threatens domestic LiDAR manufacturing ca- pacity and puts our security at risk. Question 1.a. What can the Department do today under its existing authorities to prevent further federal spending on technology manufactured by Chinese military companies, such as LiDAR sensors? ANSWER. The Department is certainly aware of these national security concerns. We are aware that LiDAR is an increasingly essential element of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving System (ADS) systems, that China holds approximately 60% of the global market for automotive LiDAR, and that LiDAR is increasingly being used to collect detailed information for infrastruc- ture planning, design, construction and maintenance. We also note that China has proposed a technology export ban on LiDAR from China. The Department does not set procurement rules or guidance outside of the Fed- eral Acquisition Regulation (FAR) or of requirements contained in legislation. The Department implements all requirements of the FAR and of guidance and direction provided by cognizant Departments and Agencies (e.g., Department of Commerce/ Bureau of Industry and Security regulations, Federal Communications Commission ban on certain equipment authorizations, FY19 National Defense Authorization Act Section 889). The Department’s implementation of such guidance is limited to Fed- eral contracts and covered subcontractors; the Department has no authority to pro- hibit the operation, procurement, or contracting for LiDAR equipment beyond Feder- ally-owned or -contracted assets and cannot issue such prohibition to recipients of Federal financial assistance (grants) or to the private sector. Further, the Department is aware of and engaged with Department of Commerce/ Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) on BIS’s advance notice of proposed rule- making, ‘‘Securing the Information and Communications Technology and Services Supply Chain: Connected Vehicles’’ (89 FR 15066; March 1, 2024). BIS sought public comment on issues and questions related to transactions involving information and communications technology and services (ICTS) that are designed, developed, manu- factured, or supplied by persons owned by, controlled by, or subject to the jurisdic- tion or direction of foreign countries or foreign nongovernment persons identified in the Department’s regulations, pursuant to the Executive Order (E.O.) entitled ‘‘Se- curing the Information and Communications Technology and Services Supply Chain,’’ and that are integral to connected vehicles (CVs), including LiDAR tech- nologies. The Department will implement any BIS determination of technologies and market participants that may be most appropriate for regulation pursuant to the E.O. Question 1.b. Given the risks that Chinese LiDAR sensors pose to U.S. national security, does the Department of Transportation support Congress enacting legisla- tion to prohibit taxpayer spending through the Department’s various grant and for- mula funding programs on Chinese LiDAR sensors that pose national security risks identified by the Department of Defense and the Congressional Research Service? ANSWER. The Department will work to implement any legislation that Congress may enact. Question 2. Secretary Buttigieg, in December 2023, FMCSA made effective a rule that narrows the scope of automatic regulatory relief when an emergency has been declared. The rule reduced automatic regulatory relief to 14 days, as opposed to the current standard of 30 days. Your agency admitted in its final rule it had ‘‘no spe- cific quantitative evidence that the current emergency exemption rules have led to a degradation of safety.’’ 1 I have concerns that shortening the automatic emergency window restricts Governors’ ability to respond during stressful and often time-sen- sitive disasters, and unnecessarily limits the ability of truckers to respond to emer- gencies. This is especially true when responding to disasters that require long-term recovery, such as the devastating flooding South Dakota and surrounding states en- countered in June 2024. When asked about the data justification for this regulatory change in past inquir- ies, your administration responded that the 14-day period will allow sufficient time 1 Clarification to the Applicability of Emergency Exemptions, 88 Fed. Reg. 70897 (Oct. 13, 2023), available at https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/10/13/2023-22538/clarifica- tion-to-the-applicability-of-emergency-exemptions.

This explanation did not address the core concern for lack of an evidentiary record for the change. Question 2.a. What specifically prompted FMCSA to reduce the automatic regu- latory relief time period from 30 to 14 days, if no quantitative evidence called for the change? ANSWER. FMCSA reduced both the scope of the automatic regulatory relief and the duration to provide safety guardrails when there is a state emergency declara- tion. FMCSA proposed taking this action because the Agency believes that most di- rect assistance to emergencies necessitates relief only from the hours-of-service re- quirements, and that the need for relief generally ends within 5 days. Therefore, FMCSA initially proposed a 5-day period. However, as noted in the preamble of the final rule, FMCSA acknowledged there may be circumstances that result in the need for more time for responders to complete their emergency relief efforts. In certain cases, coordination efforts between the State and FMCSA may take longer than a 5-day exemption period would allow. Therefore, in the final rule, FMCSA revised the duration of the automatic regulatory relief triggered by a regional declaration of emergency to 14 days. The emergency exemption is intended to facilitate direct assistance incident to the immediate restoration of essential services or essential supplies and not for trans- portation related to long-term rehabilitation of damaged physical infrastructure or routine commercial deliveries after the initial threat to life and property has passed. FMCSA believes the 14-day time limit represents an important safety guardrail and does not believe it will result in a delay in providing relief to interstate motor car- riers providing direct assistance in response to emergencies. In those cases where an extension of a declaration is necessary, FMCSA is still able to grant an extension either on its own initiative or by request. FMCSA is currently preparing responses to several petitions for reconsideration of the final rule asking FMCSA to reconsider the 14-day provision. Question 2.b. Is there data showing the 30-day limit posed a safety risk? Is there data showing 14 days reduces said risk? ANSWER. FMCSA does not have a quantitative analysis comparing the risk of a 30-day limit to a 14-day limit. However, as noted in the final rule, the Agency be- lieves decreasing the period to 14 days reduces the safety risks associated with the automatic regulatory relief provided with the initial emergency declaration by sig- nificantly reducing the amount of time drivers operate outside of the hours-of-serv- ice regulations. Question 2.c. During my line of questioning, we discussed the need for greater flexibility for Governors in times of need. Do you have concerns the FMCSA’s rule may do the opposite? ANSWER. The 2023 final rule does not limit Governors’ ability to make emergency declarations to support the delivery of critical supplies and the restoration of vital services to their constituents following an emergency. FMCSA’s emergency exemp- tion rule is intended to facilitate direct assistance incident to the immediate restora- tion of essential services or essential supplies and not for transportation related to long-term rehabilitation of damaged physical infrastructure or routine commercial deliveries after the initial threat to life and property has passed. FMCSA believes the new time limit represents an important safety guardrail and does not delay re- lief to interstate motor carriers providing direct assistance in response to emer- gencies. In those cases where an extension of a declaration is necessary, FMCSA is able to grant an extension either on its own initiative or by request. In fact, the final rule made it even easier for states to seek relief by providing one centralized email inbox address for making extension requests, as opposed to directing states to one of several FMCSA field offices. Requests from states to FMCSA that the Agency issue its own initial emergency exemption (when the State for various reasons prefers that FMCSA rather than State do so) ordinarily come into FMCSA within hours of the event, or even, in the case of approaching storms, a few days before any damage begins to occur. States have rarely if ever needed more than a day or two—a week at the most—to submit a request to FMCSA for an emergency exemption. And in every case, on many scores of occasions over the past 20 years, FMCSA has issued its responsive declaration within a few days, often within hours. Most recently, on July 8, 2024, Governor Noem of South Dakota transmitted an extension request for an emergency exemption at 4:30 pm on the 14th day of an exemption triggered by her emergency declaration, and FMCSA issued the extension prior to VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00128 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN119 the exemption’s 11:59 p.m. expiration that evening.

PETE BUTTIGIEG, SECRETARY OF TRANSPOR- TATION, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, FROM HON. JEF- FERSON VAN DREW Question 1. Secretary Buttigieg, as you’ve said publicly there is an ongoing and longstanding shortage of air traffic controllers. The FAA’s request to increase the annual controller hiring target to 2,000 for FY25, with plans for additional increases in future years, is a step in the right direction. The FAA’s efforts to establish the Enhanced-CTI program to bolster the ranks of new controller trainees is also a wel- come development. However, much work remains, and this will be a long-term effort to resolve the air traffic controller staffing shortage. I understand that the FAA, in a recent brief- ing to aviation stakeholders, indicated it plans to reduce the controller hiring tar- gets in FY27 and FY28 after planned increases in FY25 and FY26. However, the recently enacted Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization Act of 2024 requires the FAA to set annual hiring controller targets at the maximum num- ber able to be trained at the FAA Academy through FY28, and to study and imple- ment an expansion of the Academy’s capacity. Question 1.a. As you have noted, solving the ongoing shortage of air traffic con- trollers is a priority for DOT and FAA. Will DOT and FAA commit to complying with the ATC maximum hiring provisions through FY28 as the law now requires? ANSWER. Ensuring that the FAA returns to healthy staffing levels remains among my top priorities. The FAA exceeded its goal of hiring 1,800 air traffic controllers in 2024, with a final total of 1,811 for Fiscal Year 2024. As the largest number of hires in nearly a decade, this marks important progress in the FAA’s work to re- verse the decades-long air traffic controller staffing level decline. The 2024 Con- troller Workforce Plan released in April included facility-specific staffing targets from both the Staffing Standards process and the Collaborative Resource Workgroup process. We are committed to completing a study comparing these two staffing mod- els and methodologies, and implementing the model selected by the FAA Adminis- trator as outlined in section 437 of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024. We regularly monitor and assess our current staffing and attrition levels and pub- lish our staffing needs and outlook annually in the Controller Workforce Plan. We are planning hiring efforts to exceed controller attrition due to retirements, pro- motions, or other losses. Our hiring needs for FY27 and FY28 will depend on the impact of the work we are doing today to outpace attrition. Question 1.b. Regarding the FAA Training Academy and getting more controllers hired and trained, what key factors may you need to review? Do you anticipate any major challenges to expanding training capacity, and what is a realistic timeline for these actions? ANSWER. With higher FY25 CWP training requirements, the FAA has been exe- cuting a plan to increase overall air traffic training capacity at the Academy by 30% for FY25. This increase supports both Initial Qualification Training (IQT) for new hire students (Track 1), and Non-Job-Jeopardy (NJJ) field students that circle back to the FAA Academy for initial qualification training. This capacity expansion is on track to meet FY25’s hiring goals, which represent an increase over the FY24 hiring goal. As instructors are key to the success of this effort, the FAA expects to continue to utilize both FAA employees and contract instructors. Accordingly, the FAA is cur- rently working with a contractor to ensure that instructor availability is commensu- rate with the FY25 increase in training demand and releasing Certified Professional Controllers from the field for the FAA Academy instructor requirements. Question 2. The FAA’s budget request included a new proposal for a Facility Re- placement and Radar Modernization (FRRM) program, totaling an extra $1 billion above base appropriations for FY25 and $8 billion total over the next five years. Many aviation industry stakeholders and observers have expressed concerns about the FAA’s continued reliance on aging equipment and facilities. I share those con- cerns. Question 2.a. First, would you please explain why the FAA made this new re- quest, and why it’s important to fix this aging FAA infrastructure? ANSWER. The FAA shoulders the crucial responsibility of overseeing the infra- structure of a vast network of nearly 350 air traffic control towers (ATCT) and ter- minal radar approach control (TRACON) facilities, in addition to managing 21 air VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00129 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN120 route traffic control centers (ARTCC). Re-capitalization is necessary to sustain safe and efficient National Airspace System (NAS) operations in the decades to come. A failure to replace facilities and modernize radar networks in a timely manner will degrade FAA’s capacity to keep pace with the aviation economy and undermine op- portunities to improve safety. Facilities: The FAA confronts a pressing challenge—aging buildings. Air traffic control facilities have structural deficiencies and chronic issues that cannot be re- solved through maintenance or sustainment work. These issues include water leaks, mold, tower cab window condensation, deterioration due to old designs, and general disrepair. Drivers for replacement include material degradation; deficiencies in building codes compliance; and poor insulation and energy efficiency. As the age of these facilities continues to rise, these types of issues will grow exponentially. Air traffic controllers must have safe and secure towers to effectively manage and en- sure the safety of air traffic. Replacement of these structures will provide the new standard in construction, health, safety, and operational efficiency. Many of the FAA’s facilities are large and complex, often requiring expensive and lengthy replacement efforts. Due to their size, costs are typically spread out across multiple fiscal years and the instability of annual appropriations can make it dif- ficult to commit funding to such projects. By proposing a new stream of funding over the next five years, the FAA’s proposal offers an opportunity to replace at least 20 of these aging facilities. Radar Systems: The FAA’s plan also focuses on the timely and strategic mod- ernization of surveillance radars. Airports use these radars to detect and display the presence and position of aircraft in the terminal area as well as the airspace around airports. The aging radars pose a significant challenge for air traffic management. As these radar systems age, they are more prone to technological obsolescence, mak- ing it increasingly difficult to maintain their performance and integrate them with modern aviation infrastructure. The potential for increased downtime due to repairs can negatively impact airport operations and compromise the efficiency of air traffic control. Moreover, aging radar systems struggle to keep pace with the growing de- mands of air travel and evolving regulatory standards. To address these challenges, this plan invests in the replacement of radars opting for new technologies that offer improved performance, enhanced reliability, and compatibility with the latest air traffic management initiatives. The FAA maintains 618 radar systems across the nation. These systems, deployed across many decades, are a critical tool used by air traffic controllers to safely and efficiently manage air traffic. Modern aviation could not exist without these radar systems. In addition to the re-capitalization of air traffic control facilities discussed above, this proposal will allow the FAA to replace and modernize 60 percent of its radars by 2031. FAA radar systems provide safety critical information to air traffic controllers, in- cluding an aircraft’s position and identity as well as weather information. FAA radar systems provide a backup to Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast in- formation, providing essential information in the event of Global Positioning System (GPS) degradation. This information is also essential for homeland security and na- tional defense missions. As FAA radar systems exceed their intended lifespan, out- ages increase in frequency and duration, and service restoration becomes more dif- ficult as antiquated components become increasingly difficult to obtain. The absence of critical aircraft position and identity information increases the risk of airborne collision and results in increased separation requirements, reducing operational effi- ciency. Question 2.b. The FAA reauthorization bill includes a provision that allows the FAA to submit an ‘‘unfunded priorities’’ list to Congress and to DOT for ATC system Facility & Equipment needs that were not included in the President’s budget. Will you allow FAA to use this authority? ANSWER. Yes, the FAA provides the ‘‘unfunded priorities’’ list, as required by sec- tion 213 of the reauthorization law. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024 includes a requirement that the FAA Ad- ministrator notify the Secretary of Transportation, the Committee on Transpor- tation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives, and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate on any unfunded capital in- vestment needs of the air traffic control system that the President did not include in the annual budget request. The FAA Administrator will provide a summary de- scription of the unfunded capital investment need(s); the objective to be achieved if the unfunded capital investment need is funded in whole or in part; the additional amount of funds recommended in connection with each objective; the budget line item program and budget line item number associated with each capital investment VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00130 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN121 need (as applicable); and the statutory requirement associated with such unfunded capital investment need (as applicable). Finally, the briefing will present the un- funded capital investment need(s) in overall urgency of priority. Question 3. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024 included a provision to require the FAA to equip all of its towers with Tower Simulation Systems (TSS) technology. TSS systems—ranging from permanent large systems to mobile ‘‘suitcase’’ systems— allow controllers and controller trainees to conduct realistic training scenarios that are not easily replicated in day-to-day operations such as severe weather events, runway closures, and in-flight emergencies. This training is important for both new controllers and experienced controllers who must undergo recurrent training. From what I understand, TSS technology is cost-effective and has reduced train- ing time by 27%, but it is currently present at only about 70 of the 263 FAA-oper- ated towers. The FAA’s budget request asks for about $5 million to upgrade TSS capabilities, add network connectivity, and provide additional simulators to expand the program. Could you please elaborate on how FAA is using TSS to enhance controller train- ing, and why expanding the program would be beneficial to ATC operations? And please provide the Committee with updated budget estimates to install TSS at every FAA tower, along with making all of the necessary system and network updates moving forward? ANSWER. The TSS provides an immersive environment where new hire trainees can learn and practice their decision-making skills and current air traffic control procedures in a controlled environment. It gives the trainee an opportunity to work traffic and practice scenarios that they might see when they become a controller at an ATC facility. A reduction in time to certification allows the FAA to get a new hire out to the field faster so that they can then certify at their assigned facility. The TSS is a valuable tool for ATC operations and overall safety in the National Airspace System because it allows a Certified Professional Controller (CPC) to com- plete refresher training and practice their skills in the same controlled environment. It also allows the CPC to practice emergency procedures. Expanding the TSS foot- print allows us to supply all ATC facilities with vital training equipment, so CPCs are prepared to respond to safety-related procedures as well as maintain their cer- tification without concern of travel or significant time away from their position to do so. The FAA must complete its due diligence before procuring any additional simula- tors. We want to ensure that we have accounted for all considerations, including control tower space constraints before we begin deployment. For FY 2025, $5.1 mil- lion is requested to add capabilities to the TSSs to reduce overall maintenance costs and acquire additional simulators to expand the program’s current footprint. QUESTIONS TO HON. PETE BUTTIGIEG, SECRETARY OF TRANSPOR- TATION, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, FROM HON. BUR- GESS OWENS Question 1. Mr. Buttigieg, what are your department’s plans to prevent a poten- tial strike at the East and Gulf Coast ports on September 30 and if the strike does occur, what steps will be taken to mitigate the harm to the American consumer? ANSWER. Along with our partners at the Department of Labor and in the White House, we engaged with both parties to bring them to the table and reach a ten- tative agreement on wages that ended the strike after less than 72 hours. We’re carefully monitoring the continuing negotiations between the International Long- shoremen’s Association and the United States Maritime Alliance. We know how im- portant the supply chain is to keep our economy productive and prices low. We sup- port the collective bargaining process and encourage the parties to continue to bar- gain. Question 2. Mr. Buttigieg, USDOT recently updated the estimate of August Redis- tribution of unused federal highway dollars to $8.7 billion. This is a huge amount of dollars being asked of the state DOTs to obligate, due to the slow-spending com- petitive grant programs administered by the department. What kind of flexibility are you providing to make sure that states have the tools necessary to handle this ask? And what are you doing about this in the longer term to avoid what seems like a fire drill each summer? ANSWER. FHWA engaged in early and consistent outreach to states on August Re- distribution to help them plan for another large redistribution in FY 2024. In May 2024, FHWA notified states of their share of an updated estimate of $8.7 billion for the FY 2024 August Redistribution for planning purposes. VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00131 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN122 FHWA has taken steps to speed up project delivery and is working to reduce the time it takes to process grant agreements from award announcement to obligation, including obligation of discretionary grant funds that are subject to obligation limi- tation. This will lower the amount of obligation limitation redistributed each fiscal year. FHWA Division Offices collaborated with State DOTs to identify potential projects, obligate discretionary grant funding, and utilize planning and program- ming flexibilities. Additionally, FHWA worked closely with FTA to determine transit capital activities that were ready for obligation as an option of transferring funds to FTA for eligible transit projects and coordinated with FTA to transfer funding late into September to provide maximum flexibility. For FY 2024, states requested approximately $9 billion of additional formula obligation limitation under August Redistribution, an amount that exceeded the amount of obligation limitation re- turned for redistribution. On August 27, 2024, FHWA successfully redistributed ap- proximately $8.7 billion in obligation limitation to the states. The formal process for the next August Redistribution will commence in July 2025. Additionally, the FY 2025 President’s Budget request proposes legislative lan- guage to address this annual statutory issue. If enacted, the legislative proposal would have an immediate impact on the FY 2025 August Redistribution by lowering the amount estimated to be redistributed by approximately $3.2 billion. This legisla- tive proposal would also have a beneficial impact to the FY 2026 obligation limita- tion distribution, providing states with more of their formula obligation limitation up front. Further, the FY 2025 President’s Budget proposes to repurpose $800 million in unobligated balances from the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innova- tion Act (TIFIA) program to fund the National Infrastructure Project Assistance grant program (Mega) and the local and regional project assistance grant program (Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity, or RAISE). The repurposing proposal would have a positive impact on the August Redistribu- tion process by redirecting the carryover of TIFIA funding to Mega and RAISE, which would reduce the amount available for August Redistribution and thus allevi- ate some of the burden on the states. The Department is happy to work with Con- gress on how we can address August Redistribution. Question 3. Mr. Buttigieg, as you know, there is considerable concern within the transportation stakeholder community regarding USDOT’s proposal to discontinue the long-standing waiver of Buy America requirements for manufactured products. Manufacturers, state departments of transportation and local governments are all struggling with how the elimination of the current waiver can be implemented with- out significant project delays, cancellations or cost increases. Is USDOT willing to have a multi-year transition process for the implementation of Buy America requirements for manufactured products? And is USDOT also will- ing to consider an expanded use of targeted waivers of Buy America requirements for products that cannot be reasonably sourced domestically? ANSWER. On March 12, 2024, FHWA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to discontinue its longstanding general waiver of Buy America require- ments for manufactured products and establish standards for applying the agency’s statutory Buy America requirements to manufactured products. The public comment period closed on May 13, 2024. A final rule was submitted to OMB on October 7, 2024. FHWA also acknowledged in the preamble to the NPRM that ‘‘there may be some products that are not currently produced in the United States and, for various rea- sons, might not be able to be produced in the United States in the near future. For such products, FHWA intends to consider whether it should propose any targeted waivers, with these waivers providing a timeline to encourage manufacturers to ramp up domestic production. To that end, FHWA is concurrently publishing a Re- quest for Information (RFI), seeking specific and detailed information on what prod- ucts are not and cannot be produced in the United States in the near future. Based on information received, FHWA intends to propose time-limited and targeted waiv- ers covering such products, if it determines it would be appropriate to do so.’’ Through the NPRM, FHWA also sought comment on whether a ‘‘transition period is needed for its proposed standards for manufactured products to allow contracting agencies, contractors, and manufacturers time to create appropriate systems and processes, as well as train staff on compliance with the proposed standards. The FHWA specifically seeks comment on the minimum time required for these purposes and, accordingly, the effective date for the proposed Buy America requirements for manufactured products.’’ VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00132 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN123 FHWA will consider the information received through the RFI and comments re- ceived as it determines its next steps regarding any potential targeted, time-limited waivers for specific products. Question 4. Mr. Buttigieg, recently, the Highways and Transit Subcommittee heard testimony about labor supply challenges in the industry. Transit workforce development is critical to keeping the nations’ investment in transit viable. In my state, the Utah Transit Authority has created a program called Bilingual Bridges, an English as a Second Language (ESL) pilot partnership with the Utah State Board of Education, Granite School District, and the Utah Department of Workforce Services. This program, which has now graduated two classes with ESL certificates, is a paid, integrated ESL and job skills training course lasting between 8 and 12 weeks, which prepares participants to work at UTA while learning English. Can you please share how your Department will help agencies fund and supervise training programs such as this? ANSWER. FTA provides flexibility to transit agencies to use various FTA funding sources for their unique workforce training needs, including those related to ESL training. There are four main sources of funds FTA recipients may use for workforce development activities. Recipients can use FTA’s Technical Assistance and Work- force Development Program (49 U.S.C. § 5314), FTA’s Urbanized Area Program (49 U.S.C. § 5307), FTA’s State of Good Repair Program (49 U.S.C. § 5337), and FTA’s Bus and Bus Facilities Program (49 U.S.C. § 5339). There are specific provisions re- lated to each of these programs and FTA would be happy to share more details if needed on these various funding opportunities. QUESTIONS TO HON. PETE BUTTIGIEG, SECRETARY OF TRANSPOR- TATION, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, FROM HON. RUDY YAKYM III Question 1. As you well know, there is a longstanding, acute shortage of air traffic controllers. The FAA’s request to increase the annual controller hiring target to 2,000 for FY25, with plans for additional increases in future years, is a step in the right direction, as are its efforts to establish the Enhanced-CTI program. However, much work remains. I am troubled by reports that the FAA, in a recent briefing to aviation stakeholders, indicated it plans to reduce controller hiring tar- gets in FY27 and FY28 after planned increases in FY25 and FY26. This contravenes the recent FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024, which requires the FAA to set annual hiring controller targets at the maximum number able to be trained at the FAA Academy through FY28. Question 1.a. Will DOT and FAA commit to complying with the ATC maximum hiring provisions through FY28 as the law now requires? ANSWER. Ensuring that the FAA returns to healthy staffing levels remains among my top priorities. The FAA exceeded its goal of hiring 1,800 air traffic controllers in 2024, with a final total of 1,811 for Fiscal Year 2024. As the largest number of hires in nearly a decade, this marks important progress in the FAA’s work to re- verse the decades-long air traffic controller staffing level decline. The 2024 Con- troller Workforce Plan released in April included facility-specific staffing targets from both the Staffing Standards process and the Collaborative Resource Workgroup process. We are committed to completing a study comparing these two staffing mod- els and methodologies, and implementing the model selected by the FAA Adminis- trator as outlined in section 437 of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024. We regularly monitor and assess our current staffing and attrition levels and pub- lish our staffing needs and outlook annually in the Controller Workforce Plan. We are planning hiring efforts to exceed controller attrition due to retirements, pro- motions, or other losses. Our hiring needs for FY27 and FY28 will depend on the impact of the work we are doing today to outpace attrition. Question 1.b. Do you anticipate any major challenges to expanding the FAA Train- ing Academy’s training capacity, and what is a realistic timeline for these actions? ANSWER. With higher FY25 CWP training requirements, the FAA has been exe- cuting a plan to increase overall air traffic training capacity at the Academy by 30% for FY25. This increase supports both Initial Qualification Training (IQT) for new hire students (Track 1), and Non-Job-Jeopardy (NJJ) field students that circle back to the FAA Academy for initial qualification training. This capacity expansion is on track to meet FY25’s hiring goals, which represent an increase over FY24’s hiring goal. As instructors are key to the success of this effort, the FAA expects to continue to utilize both FAA employees and contract instructors. Accordingly, the FAA is cur- VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00133 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN124 rently working with a contractor to ensure that instructor availability is commensu- rate with the FY25 increase in training demand and releasing Certified Professional Controllers from the field for the FAA Academy instructor requirements. Question 2. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024 required that the FAA put for- ward its draft Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) rule for by mid-September. Given the delays that have occurred and the impact a BVLOS rule would have by unlocking innovation and driving economic activity, can you commit today that DOT and FAA will prioritize meeting this legally-mandated deadline and put forward a draft BVLOS rule by September 15, 2024? ANSWER. The FAA is working to publish the notice of proposed rulemaking, ‘‘Nor- malizing Unmanned Aircraft Systems Beyond Visual Line of Sight Operations,’’ which is expected to expedite the introduction of BVLOS operations. In the mean- time, the FAA has streamlined approval processes for BVLOS operations approved through waivers or exemptions and is working to exercise the flexibility provided in the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024 to enable more scalable BVLOS operations in advance of rulemaking. Question 3. Drone technology is increasingly used for inspecting critical transpor- tation infrastructure, such as bridges, tunnels, and highways, due to its ability to enhance worker safety and improve productivity. Given the recent authorization of the Drone Infrastructure Inspection Grant program in the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024, how do you plan to prioritize the use of drone operations in areas such as infrastructure inspections? Additionally, could you provide insight into the funding strategies and measures you will carry out to ensure that these advancements in technology translate into tangible safety benefits for workers involved in these crit- ical inspection and maintenance activities? ANSWER. Infrastructure inspection using safe and reliable, domestically produced drones presents a way to better ensure the safety and stability of the national infra- structure and to enable economic benefits of drones. These inspections can and do happen across the country today under 14 CFR Part 107 line of sight operations. The Department uses drones to inspect critical highway infrastructure. The Depart- ment appreciates Congress’ support in developing this capability through provisions in the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024 (Pub. L. 118–63, May 16, 2024) that would enable the FAA to inspect its own infrastructure and manage a grant program for state governments to establish their own drone inspection programs. While this new program introduces important requirements, it has not yet received appropriations sufficient to fully implement them. We look forward to collaborating with Congress to ensure that adequate funding is secured for all new programs mandated by the Reauthorization. The Department is fully committed to meeting the legislative re- quirements for this and all provisions of the FAA Reauthorization. We are currently developing a management strategy that will allow us to implement the infrastruc- ture inspection program to the best of our ability, despite competing priorities and financial constraints. QUESTIONS TO HON. PETE BUTTIGIEG, SECRETARY OF TRANSPOR- TATION, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, FROM HON. DER- RICK VAN ORDEN Question 1. Assaults on transit workers are at an all-time high. While some of the discourse about crime on public transit is exaggerated, the threat to workers is very real. The perception of public safety on public transit is one of the main rea- sons passengers have been slow to return to public transit. Until this issue is solved, transit agencies will continue to struggle with farebox revenue. The FTA has ac- knowledged the importance of this issue through in its General Directive on Pre- venting Assaults. Question 1.a. Secretary Buttigieg, what is the timeline for action on the general directive and further rulemakings to protect workers and riders from assault? ANSWER. DOT and FTA are committed to ensuring the safety of transit workers nationwide who are responsible for moving millions of Americans to their jobs, schools, and other daily activities. Everyone deserves a safe workplace, including and especially the frontline transit workers. FTA issued General Directive 24–1 on September 25, 2024. The General Directive, the first one to be issued by FTA, will require more than 700 transit agencies nationwide to take action to protect frontline transit workers from the risk of assaults. It requires each transit agency to do the following: • Conduct a risk assessment of assaults on the agency’s transit workforce, using the Safety Management System processes outlined in its Agency Safety Plan. VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00134 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN125 • If a transit agency has determined it has an unacceptable level of risk of as- saults on transit workers, it must identify strategies to mitigate that risk and improve transit worker safety. • Every transit agency serving a large, urbanized area (with a population of 200,000 or more) must comply with Public Transportation Agency Safety Plans (PTASP) requirements to involve the joint labor-management Safety Committee when identifying safety risk mitigations and strategies. • Finally, each transit agency must provide information to FTA within 90 days on the risk level identified in its system, how it is mitigating those risks, and how it is monitoring the safety risk associated with assaults on transit workers. Transit agencies are required to respond to the General Directive by December 26, 2024. The General Directive builds upon previous steps by the Biden-Harris Ad- ministration to strengthen transit worker safety. FTA intends to use information submitted to it pursuant to the General Directive and other FTA initiatives to inform future FTA actions, including rulemakings such as the planned Transit Worker and Public Safety rule. In 2025, FTA anticipates publishing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), which will propose estab- lishing minimum baseline standards and risk-based requirements to address transit worker and public safety, including but not limited to Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act) (Pub. L. 114–94, Dec. 4, 2015) section 3022 require- ments. Question 1.b. What effects does the perception of violence onboard public transpor- tation have across transit systems (ridership, worker retention and recruitment, se- curity costs, etc.)? ANSWER. While crime rates are down across the country, FTA believes that transit riders deserve to feel safe as they travel around their communities, and transit workers deserve a safe workplace. That is part of why FTA requires at least 1 per- cent of all urban transit formula funding be spent on security for transit systems. In addition, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law requires at least .75 percent of all urban transit formula funding to be set aside for safety, which includes efforts to prevent assaults on transit workers. FTA is currently funding research through the Transit Cooperative Research Pro- gram (TCRP) on Improving Transit Customer Perception of Personal Security. The project will document the current practices transit systems use to improve customer perception of personal security, including the strategies that are being used to in- crease customer perception of security on transit; whether the strategies are suc- cessful; how these strategies are communicated to the public; and the associated change in customers’ perceptions. FTA recently published a new Transit Customer Assault Prevention webpage for transit agencies to provide more resources to help prevent and address crime in their systems, which includes research on the factors contributing to customer assault events, trends in assault data, and mitigations. FTA is also working with agencies nationwide to promote best practices that have been shown to reduce crime in and around transit facilities, including increased se- curity personnel, non-uniformed ambassadors and other active measures to protect the riding public and individuals in need of supportive social services. FTA also con- tinues to work to protect transit workers through landmark rulemaking recently fi- nalized to implement the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL). That regulation, the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plans final rule, gives transit workers more of a voice in the safety and security of themselves, their passengers and the systems they operate. To help ensure the continued safety of our nation’s public transit systems, FTA launched the Enhanced Transit Safety and Crime Prevention Initiative to provide information and resources to help transit agencies address and prevent crime on their systems and protect transit workers and riders. FTA resources can be used by transit agencies to prevent and address crime in their systems and protect tran- sit workers and riders. Certain agencies can also use these resources for overtime pay for enhanced security personnel presence and mental health and crisis interven- tion specialists. Question 2. Prior to beginning a journey, each freight rail car connected to a train is required to undergo an inspection. Car inspectors are often required to perform this 100+ point inspection in less than 60 seconds for each car for trains that extend for as long as 3 miles. Railroads have recently begun testing AI alternatives to quickly test rail cars in motion as a substitute for the traditional inspection process. Secretary Buttigieg, how are you reviewing new rail technology like this in light of the Department’s Innovation Principles? VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00135 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN126 ANSWER. DOT and FRA are committed to implementing the Department’s Innova- tion Principles, and technology plays a key role, as do workers. Following the Nor- folk Southern derailment in East Palestine, OH, on February 3, 2023, I called on Norfolk Southern and the entire freight railroad industry to act immediately to de- ploy new inspection technologies without seeking permission to abandon human in- spections. Requests have been framed by industry to set up a false choice between technology and human oversight. We need both to keep our nation’s railroads safe. FRA has a long history of working with railroads and the supply industry to de- velop, test, verify, and validate technology solutions, as well as addressing com- ments from labor organizations, other stakeholders, and the public when evaluating technology for approval to operate. Importantly, in some situations and depending on the new technology, FRA may not have a role in its implementation. An often- overlooked aspect of introducing new technology is ensuring that railroad employees are properly trained to safely use new technology. In addition, FRA encourages the railroads to engage with rail labor organizations at different stages in the develop- ment of technology to leverage the knowledge and experience of the workers and ob- tain their support for implementation. In some situations, FRA’s Office of Railroad Safety provides assistance in the de- velopment of new technology and in navigating the regulatory requirements for im- plementation in the form of attending design reviews, providing subject matter ex- pertise, observing testing, and if necessary, approving or disapproving a railroad’s request for use of new technology in revenue operations. FRA’s support in the indus- try’s successful implementation of Positive Train Control (PTC), a development and implementation process covering more than a dozen years, is an example of this co- ordination and cooperation. The agency plans to leverage these existing processes to assist in the introduction of new technology, including those based on AI, to en- able their safe introduction into the system. Question 3. CRISI grants help short line railroads repair and rehabilitate worn- out track and rail infrastructure—the leading cause of derailments on short line railroads. Short line freight railroads operate nearly 50,000 miles of the national freight rail network and have been successfully competing for these resources since the program was created in 2015’s FAST Act (but first funded in 2017), making their rail network safer—and their supply chain more efficient. Secretary Buttigieg, can you discuss the importance of ensuring CRISI funds are made available to be used to help short line freight railroads invest in safety up- grades? ANSWER. FRA’s Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements (CRISI) grant program is unique in that it can provide direct assistance to help both small and large communities invest in rail safety and capital projects for stronger supply chains, can directly support short line railroads, and make major invest- ments in intercity passenger rail. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law significantly increased the amount of funding available in CRISI, including $1 billion in advance appropriations each year, and expanded project eligibilities within the program. In response to the Fiscal Year (FY) 2023/2024 notice of funding opportunity, FRA re- viewed 271 eligible applications from 48 states and the District of Columbia, re- questing $ 7,397,542,372. In October 2024, FRA awarded $2.5 billion in FY23/24 CRISI funding to 122 rail improvement projects in 41 states and the District of Co- lumbia. Over 40 percent of this funding flowed to rural communities, and over $1.3 billion was awarded to projects that improve freight and short line railroad infra- structure, representing over 50 percent of all awards. DOT values our short line partners and their continued participation in the CRISI Program. Question 4. As we’ve seen travelers return to our nation’s airports at record levels this summer, the signs of strain on the National Airspace System seem more appar- ent in the form of traveler delays and disruptions, safety incidents, and the imposi- tion of ‘‘voluntary’’ limits on slots to key airports. I know that travelers from my state of Wisconsin have been directly impacted by these issues. Air traffic controller workforce issues have contributed to this strain, as FAA Administrator Whitaker noted in his remarks when he met with NATCA in February. Question 4.a. Secretary Buttigieg, can you provide an update on the status of con- troller hiring and training initiatives? ANSWER. We continue to work on several initiatives to increase our hiring pipeline and bolster training throughput. The FAA has a robust hiring process in place to ensure that the best candidates are selected and placed at facilities with the great- est need. We’ve taken the following actions to recruit, train, and hire the best can- didates for ATC positions: • Revised our Academy placement process for Academy graduates offering more locations to reduce the need for controller transfers. VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00136 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN127 • Revised the Previous Experience Public Notice Announcement to provide great- er flexibility to applicants departing the military. • Revised the Tier 2 Medical/Minnesota Multi-Phase Personality Inventory (MMPI) Retest Process, resulting in both cost savings and an increase in appli- cants. • Invested in En Route and Tower simulation technology, adding an additional En Route lab at the FAA Academy, and modernization of our Tower Simulation System across the National Airspace System. • Successfully launched the Enhanced Air Traffic Collegiate Training Initiative (E–CTI), which will not only increase our hiring input but also will bolster throughput. To date, 32 schools have applied and three have successfully com- pleted the certification process. In FY 2024, the FAA hired 1,811 new controllers, surpassing the year’s goal of 1,800 and the 1,514 controllers hired in FY 2023. For FY 2025, the FAA has in- creased its hiring goal to 2,000 air traffic controllers. Question 4.b. Can you also provide an estimate of when you expect these initia- tives to eliminate the need for voluntary slot restrictions and address safety and delay concerns? ANSWER. The Slot Administration program office continues to monitor these initia- tives and manage slot usage waivers according to their progress. Effective on Octo- ber 27, 2024, staffing-related relief will continue via the extended Limited Waiver of the Slot Usage Requirement, originally published on September 20, 2023, through the Winter 2024/2025 Slot season and until the end of the Summer 2025 Slot Sea- son on October 25, 2025. The FAA expects increased delays and cancellations in the New York region to exceed those experienced over Summer 2022 and Winter 2022/2023 if a waiver simi- lar to the one that has been in effect for the Summer 2023, Winter 2023/2024, and Summer 2024 season is not in place for the Winter 2024/2025 and Summer 2025 scheduling season to allow carriers to reduce schedules without penalties for non- use of slots or previously approved operating times. Reducing schedules will improve the alignment between scheduled operations and actual operations, will help prevent unnecessary delays, will help optimize the effi- cient use of the airports’ resources, and will help deliver passengers to their destina- tions more reliably and on time. Question 5. Secretary Buttigieg, as you’ve said publicly there is an ongoing and longstanding shortage of air traffic controllers. The FAA’s request to increase the annual controller hiring target to 2,000 for FY25, with plans for additional increases in future years, is a step in the right direction. The FAA’s efforts to establish the Enhanced-CTI program to bolster the ranks of new controller trainees is also a wel- come development. However, much work remains, and this will be a long-term effort to resolve the air traffic controller staffing shortage. I understand that the FAA, in a recent brief- ing to aviation stakeholders, indicated it plans to reduce the controller hiring tar- gets in FY27 and FY28 after planned increases in FY25 and FY26. However, the recently enacted Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization Act of 2024 requires the FAA to set annual hiring controller targets at the maximum num- ber able to be trained at the FAA Academy through FY28, and to study and imple- ment an expansion of the Academy’s capacity. Question 5.a. As you have noted, solving the ongoing shortage of air traffic con- troller is a priority for DOT and FAA. Will DOT and FAA commit to complying with the ATC maximum hiring provisions through FY28 as the law now requires? ANSWER. Ensuring that the FAA returns to healthy staffing levels remains among my top priorities. The 2024 Controller Workforce Plan released in April included fa- cility-specific staffing targets from both the Staffing Standards process and the Col- laborative Resource Workgroup process. We are committed to completing a study comparing these two staffing models and methodologies, and implementing the model selected by the FAA Administrator as outlined in section 437 of the FAA Re- authorization Act of 2024. In FY 2024, the FAA hired 1,811 new controllers, surpassing the year’s goal of 1,800 and the 1,514 controllers hired in FY 2023. For FY 2025, the FAA has in- creased its hiring goal to 2,000 air traffic controllers. We regularly monitor and assess our current staffing and attrition levels and pub- lish our staffing needs and outlook annually in the Controller Workforce Plan. We are planning hiring efforts to exceed controller attrition due to retirements, pro- motions, or other losses. Our hiring needs for FY27 and FY28 will depend on the impact of the work we are doing today to outpace attrition.

Regarding the FAA Training Academy and getting more controllers hired and trained, what key factors may you need to review? Do you anticipate any major challenges to expanding training capacity, and what is a realistic timeline for these actions? ANSWER. With higher FY25 CWP training requirements, the FAA is executing a plan to increase overall air traffic training capacity at the Academy by 30% for FY25. This increase supports both Initial Qualification Training (IQT) for new hire students (Track 1), and Non-Job-Jeopardy (NJJ) field students that circle back to the FAA Academy for initial qualification training. As instructors are key to the success of this effort, the FAA expects to continue to utilize both FAA employees and contract instructors. Accordingly, the FAA is cur- rently working with a contractor to ensure that instructor availability is commensu- rate with the FY25 increase in training demand. Question 6. Earlier this year an asphalt producer from my state—The Walbec Group—testified before the House T&I Committee regarding the Administration’s Buy America rulemaking at FHWA and the long-delayed acknowledgment of Buy America exemptions for construction materials, like asphalt binder and aggregate. Unfortunately, it took 2+ years of IIJA implementation before this bipartisan provi- sion was finally affirmed at OMB. Can you provide more detail as to how you anticipate this Administration uti- lizing evolving Buy America rulemakings in the future and how your agency will provide industry partners, like construction material producers, certainty and clar- ity on this critical procurement process? ANSWER. With regard to the products that you cite, the Office of Management and Budget has consistently acknowledged the exclusion of certain types of materials from being considered construction materials under the Build America, Buy America Act (BABA), as enacted by Congress, in both its initial and final implementation guidance. DOT is following that guidance in applying the BABA requirements to its financial assistance programs for infrastructure. The Federal Highway Administra- tion has also posted guidance Q&As on its website describing the application of the BABA requirements to the Federal-aid Highway Program, including standards for construction materials. Question 7. The IIJA provided for significant investment in rural surface transpor- tation infrastructure across the country through the Rural Surface Transportation Grant Program. How is DOT supporting small and rural communities to ensure they have the re- sources necessary to take advantage of these funding opportunities? ANSWER. The Department is committed to supporting the unique transportation needs of small and Tribal communities by investing in rural America through dis- cretionary grant programs. Since 2022, we have awarded $11.5 billion in new discre- tionary grants to rebuild and modernize rural roads, bridges, transit, ports, and air- ports—which is twice as much discretionary funding awarded to rural applicants than in the previous 4 years combined. For example, the Department has awarded $900 million to 30 projects across 26 states under the Rural Surface Transportation Grant (Rural) program. We made significant strides to streamline the application process by combining the Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) for the Rural pro- gram with the INFRA and Mega programs, which gives these rural projects the best opportunity to compete for all available funding, and simplifying the evaluation cri- teria for Rural program applicants seeking less than $25 million. In addition, the Department offers technical assistance and resources to support project planning, development, and funding and financing strategies so that new and prior applicants are successful in delivering transformative infrastructure projects. Since 2022, DOT has awarded nearly $1.5 billion to first-time rural and Tribal discretionary grant applicants. • The Thriving Communities Program, funded in FY2022 and FY2023 appropria- tion bills, funds Capacity Builders who provide no-cost technical assistance to help state, local, Tribal, and territorial governments better access federal fund- ing for projects in their communities. Over 680 letters of interest have been sub- mitted by communities requesting support through the program. A total of 176 communities are currently being supported, of which two-thirds are rural. As of August 2024, 62 percent of our FY22 Thriving Communities that had never received a DOT grant became first time awardees. Between RAISE and SS4A alone, Thriving Communities have received over $71 million dollars to support critical transportation infrastructure and safety projects in communities across the country, including Douglas (AZ), Wrangell (AK), York (AL), Rexburg (ID), and the First Tennessee RPO. Thriving Communities has also coordinated with federal partners for site visits to rural and tribal communities, including Stand- VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00138 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN129 ing Rock Indian Reservation (ND and SD), Shoalwater Bay Indian Tribe (WA), and Upper Kanawha Valley (WV). • The Rural and Tribal Assistance Pilot Program funds communities seeking early-stage support in developing projects in rural and Tribal communities. DOT received over 400 applications requesting more than $127 million in re- sponse to the first NOFO. The 2024 NOFO will be out this summer and will provide $27 million ($2 million from BIL and $25 million from FY 2024 appro- priations). • Within the Office of the Under Secretary for Transportation Policy, the Rural Opportunities to Use Transportation for Economic Success (ROUTES) Initiative prioritizes the needs of rural America by supporting rural transportation policy and equitable access for rural and Tribal communities that face challenges re- lating to transportation safety, mobility, and economic development. ROUTES develops user-friendly tools and information, aggregates DOT resources, and provides technical assistance to better connect rural project sponsors with the funding, financing, and outreach resources available. For instance, the Rural Grant Applicant Toolkit for Competitive Federal Transportation Funding helps rural applicants understand the federal grant process and the opportunities that are available to support rural transportation projects. The ROUTES Initia- tive also partners with USDA’s Rural Partners Network and DOE’s Interagency Working Group on Coal & Power Plant Communities & Economic Revitalization to support rural communities in need of targeted technical assistance. Question 8. The 2024 FAA Reauthorization Act contains provisions related to high-speed and high-altitude flight. These are designed to ensure that the FAA is ready to regulate and integrate supersonic and hypersonic aircraft into our airspace when the time comes. The bill also aims to maintain U.S. leadership in aviation. President Biden’s National Aeronautics and Space Technology Priorities highlights hypersonic transportation as a priority. The State Department, together with key allies including Canada, the UK, the EU countries, and Japan, issued a joint state- ment in December 2023 calling on ICAO to prioritize and expedite higher airspace operations in its work program. How does the Department plan to accomplish this critical work, meet the dead- lines, and ensure that the United States leads the world in high-speed and high- altitude aviation? ANSWER. The FAA recognizes the numerous challenges associated with high-speed and high-altitude flight airspace provisions, including noise considerations, emis- sions, unique aircraft design challenges associated with high-speed flight, and other certification and operational considerations. The FAA works across multiple agen- cies such as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, directly engages with international aviation authorities, and participates in standards development organization meetings to support aircraft certification to ensure this critical work is well-coordinated and comprehensive. We will continue to work in partnership with aircraft manufacturers currently designing and testing prototype supersonic aircraft and engine technologies to identify drivers of new airworthiness require- ments unique to such aircraft. QUESTIONS TO HON. PETE BUTTIGIEG, SECRETARY OF TRANSPOR- TATION, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, FROM HON. MARCUS J. MOLINARO Question 1. Mr. Secretary, I understand that SAI’s structure allows for such capa- bilities. Can you work with the FAA to ensure that safety alerts are a required ca- pability for SAI as that new surface surveillance system is installed at airports throughout the country? ANSWER. The establishment of the SAI program was in response to last spring’s (2023) Safety Call to Action to reduce runway incursions. In a matter of months, the FAA released a solicitation to industry and awarded contracts to three separate solution providers, and 90 days after those contracts were awarded, the service was operational at four airports. The FAA is now focusing its efforts to deploy SAI capa- bilities as quickly as possible. The FAA has not assessed what additional surface safety capabilities might be required following the deployment of SAI. Surface safety alerting can be beneficial but can have detrimental safety impacts if not appro- priately designed and implemented. Following the deployment of the SAI capability, surface safety alerting may be considered as a future capability. Question 2. Mr. Secretary, would SAI be improved if FAA required that the new surveillance system also utilize automated safety alerts to continuously scan the sit- VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00139 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN130 uation at that airport, identify issues, and generate audible and visual alerts to the controllers when a dangerous scenario is about to occur? ANSWER. Automatic surface safety alerting can be beneficial but can have detri- mental safety impacts if not appropriately designed and implemented. Following the deployment of the SAI capability, surface safety alerting may be considered as a fu- ture capability. If the FAA decides to require safety alerting in the SAI systems, the FAA first must develop requirements to determine the safety alert capabilities which must be analyzed for safety risk, developed, tested, and implemented. Question 3. If the FAA used safety alert for all of its surface surveillance tech- nology, wouldn’t this simplify controller training and standardize operations while ensuring the same level of safety at all airports around the country? ANSWER. The current surface safety alerting capabilities are specific to the Airport Surface Detection System, Model X (ASDE–X) and ADS–B Airport Surface Surveil- lance Capability (ASSC) surface surveillance systems in use at 44 airports today. These systems have design features that are not commensurate with SAI. To the extent standardization could be implemented to simplify operations and training, that will be pursued (similar to the way the SAI user interface was standardized with the interface of the existing surface surveillance systems). Before safety alerts could be added, the FAA must develop requirements to determine the safety alert capabilities which must be analyzed for safety risk, developed, tested, and imple- mented. Question 4. Can’t the safety alerting capabilities from ASDE–X and ASSC, that the FAA invested in and refined for the last two decades, be leveraged and used for SAI? ANSWER. If the FAA determines that safety alerting is appropriate to be added into SAI, the alerting behavior of the safety alerting capabilities from ASDE–X and ASSC could be leveraged and used for SAI to the extent that they are applicable to specifics of the SAI system design. The specific safety alert capability of ASDE– X and ASSC is unique to those specific system designs. For example, SAI does not provide a surface surveillance radar detection capability, which would need to be considered in leveraging the reuse of existing safety alerting capabilities. Question 5. Mr. Secretary, would you agree that safety alerts in the control tower of potentially dangerous situations are an essential layer of ensuring airport surface safety? ANSWER. SAI being deployed today will improve safety, providing surface situa- tional awareness where such capabilities do not exist. Getting SAI deployed to addi- tional control towers is the current priority to provide a foundational safety im- provement to more locations in the National Airspace System. The FAA has not as- sessed what additional surface safety capabilities might be required following the deployment of SAI. Surface safety alerting can be beneficial but can have detri- mental safety impacts if not appropriately designed and implemented. Following the deployment of the SAI capability, surface safety alerting may be considered as a fu- ture capability. Question 6. Advanced Air Mobility promises to bring safe and efficient operations and economic growth in American communities through the certification and use of powered-lift aircraft. The future of these operations hinges on FAA’s development of the ‘powered-lift SFAR.’ It is critical that this rulemaking process thoroughly 1) incorporates the collective responses received from the NPRM last August, 2) ad- dresses the provisions of Sec. 955 of FAA Reauthorization, and 3) aligns with the ICAO standards the FAA already supports. Mr. Secretary, can you assure me that these 3 factors will be fully and comprehensively considered in the final powered- lift SFAR? ANSWER. In October 2024, the FAA published an advance copy of the final Special Federal Aviation Regulation, ‘‘Integration of Powered-Lift: Pilot Certification and Operations; Miscellaneous Amendments Related to Rotorcraft and Airplanes.’’ This final rule, promulgated in accordance with the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, addresses the requirements of section 955 of the FAA Reauthoriza- tion Act of 2024. Further, it is FAA policy to conform to International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Standards and Recommended Practices (SARP) to the max- imum extent possible. In the final rule, the FAA explained that its approach con- forms with ICAO SARPs to the maximum extent practicable and provides an equiv- alent level of safety that meets or exceeds the ICAO standards. This includes leveraging the ICAO-accepted definition of powered-lift and working with ICAO in the Advanced Air Mobility Study Group to ensure the regulatory gaps are identified and addressed in future ICAO Annexes.

PETE BUTTIGIEG, SECRETARY OF TRANSPOR- TATION, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, FROM HON. MIKE COLLINS Question 1. Passed as Section 514 of the Frank LoBiondo Coast Guard Authoriza- tion Act of 2018 and signed into law in December 2018, the National Timing Resil- ience and Security Act (Timing Act) requires the Secretary of Transportation to de- ploy a ground-based GPS backup timing system that would utilize existing but dor- mant Coast Guard communications towers through a public-private partnership (P3) within two years of enactment. The legislation was consistent with a January 2021 study conducted by the Department that recommended the implementation of three key technologies to address GPS vulnerabilities: low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, re- gional beacons, and a nationwide enhanced long-range navigation (eLORAN) serv- ice. Despite three years of appropriations from Congress to support this initiative, re- cent test beds have not included a ground-based system. This is concerning, given the critical importance of this backup system for national security and infrastruc- ture resilience. Could you please provide an update on the Department’s plans to fully implement this legislation? Specifically, what steps are being taken to expedite the deployment of the ground-based GPS backup timing system, and what is the projected timeline for its completion? ANSWER. Under 49 U.S.C. 312 (Timing Act), the Secretary of Transportation is re- quired to ‘‘provide for the establishment, sustainment, and operation of a resilient, and reliable alternative timing system’’ subject to the availability of appropriations. The Department of Transportation has not received appropriations specifically di- rected to or sufficient for such activity. However, the Department has ensured that the priority goal of availability of a resilient alternate timing system for use by crit- ical infrastructure owners and operators in the face of increasing jamming and spoofing operations against civil positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) sources, most notably GPS, has been maintained in all complementary PNT activities. The team has focused on implementing EO 13905, Strengthening National Resilience Through Responsible Use of Positioning, Navigation, and Timing Services, and Space Policy Directive 7, The United States Space-Based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing Policy (SPD–7). The former focuses on engaging the public and private sectors to identify and promote the responsible use of PNT services, rather than on system development; the latter on sustainment of GPS and GPS augmentations. In pursuit of the EO/SPD goals and the Timing Act-recognized need for alter- native timing sources, the DOT Volpe National Transportation Systems Center in 2020 conducted field demonstrations of candidate PNT technologies that could offer complementary service in the event of GPS disruptions, including terrestrial PNT technologies. The purpose of the demonstrations was to gather information on PNT technologies at a high technology readiness level (TRL) that can work in the absence of GPS. Resilient timing scenarios were among the technology demonstrations meas- ured and analyzed. The culmination of the demonstration program was the 2021 Re- port to Congress, Complementary PNT and GPS Backup Technologies Demonstra- tion Report. The report cited the Timing Act, along with the FY17 and 18 National Defense Authorization Acts, as guiding requirements for the demonstrations. As a result of this technology demonstration, DOT determined that:1) no single solution or the provision of a back-up or Complementary PNT service can meet the diversity of critical infrastructure application requirements, and 2) it would be inef- ficient, anti-competitive, and potentially harmful to the existing market for back-up/ complementary PNT services for the federal government to procure or otherwise fund a specific solution for non-federal users. This determination has guided the De- partment’s implementation of further complementary PNT activities, and not includ- ing systems development. The Department has continued to undertake efforts to further identify potential technical solutions and/or services that would ‘‘to the maximum extent practicable’’ satisfy the requirements set forth in 49 U.S.C. 312(b)(2) for an alternative timing system. In 2023, DOT published a Complementary PNT Action Plan to drive CPNT adoption across the Nation’s transportation system and within other critical infra- structure sectors. The plan describes actions that the DOT is pursuing over the next several years, including engaging PNT stakeholders; monitoring and supporting the development of CPNT specifications and standards; establishing and instrumenting field test ranges for CPNT testing and evaluation; and creating a Federal PNT Serv- ices Clearinghouse. Taken together with efforts of other Federal partners, these ini- VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00141 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN132 tiatives will continue to strengthen the resilience of the Nation’s PNT-dependent systems, resulting in safer, more secure critical infrastructure. In February 2024, DOT issued a solicitation seeking proposals from vendors with operationally ready CPNT services interested in fielding those services for test and evaluation in the Rapid Phase of the Field Trial and Test Range Development Pro- gram. DOT received 29 proposals, more proposals than could be funded under Sim- plified Acquisition Procedure guidelines. On June 18, 2024, DOT awarded contracts to nine Complementary PNT technology vendors (https://www.transportation.gov/ pnt) in response to the Rapid Phase of the DOT Complementary PNT (CPNT) Action Plan (https://www.transportation.gov/pnt/complementary-pnt-action-plan). Awarded through the DOT Volpe Center and totaling over $7.2 million, these awards provide funding for instrumentation, testing, and evaluation of CPNT tech- nologies at field test ranges in conjunction with critical infrastructure owners and operators. The technologies selected comprise a diversity of Complementary PNT technologies, including terrestrial timing capabilities. The four categories of CPNT contracts awarded are: Time Over Fiber, Terrestrial Radiofrequency (RF), Low Earth Orbit (LEO), and Map Matching/Map Tracking. The CPNT technologies will be fielded within six months after award at a diverse set of test range models (Fed- eral Government-Hosted, Critical Infrastructure, and Vendor-Fielded). DOT recognizes the quality of the proposals received and intends to move expedi- tiously to issue a Complementary PNT Rapid Phase II solicitation to expand the set of Complementary PNT technologies to be evaluated. Question 2. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024 sets out the long-term frame- work for developing hypersonic aviation in the United States. China and other coun- tries have developed an early lead in hypersonic technology. So, successful develop- ment of a U.S. hypersonic industry has broad implications for our country beyond transportation. The Department of Transportation has a leading role here. How will the Department apply lessons learned from other new technologies like drones to avoid the delays and challenges they faced to ensure that the United States can lead in this field? ANSWER. The FAA is focused on continuous improvement and will utilize the les- sons learned from the certification of drones and their integration into the National Airspace System, as well as from the certification and operations of other aircraft, to ensure we remain the worldwide leader in aviation, including hypersonic tech- nology. To do this, the FAA will leverage and strengthen our international partner- ships, directly engage with other international aviation authorities, and participate in standards development organizations as we continue to use performance-based standards to support aircraft certification. We also plan to partner directly with the Department of Defense, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and U.S. manufacturers to proactively identify and inform the development of new air- worthiness requirements for hypersonic flight-enabling technologies intended for civil aviation operations. Question 3. Advanced Air Mobility promises to bring safe and efficient operations and economic growth in American communities through the certification and use of powered-lift aircraft. The future of these operations hinges on FAA’s development of the ‘powered-lift SFAR.’ It is critical that this rulemaking process thoroughly 1) incorporates the collective responses received from the NPRM last August 2) ad- dresses the provisions of Sec. 955 of FAA Reauthorization, and 3) aligns with the ICAO standards the FAA already supports. Mr. Secretary, can you assure me that these 3 factors will be fully and comprehensively considered in the final powered- lift SFAR? ANSWER. In October 2024, the FAA published an advance copy of the final rule, ‘‘Integration of Powered-Lift: Pilot Certification and Operations; Miscellaneous Amendments Related to Rotorcraft and Airplanes.’’ This final rule, promulgated in accordance with the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, addresses the requirements of section 955 of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024. Further, it is FAA policy to conform to International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Standards and Recommended Practices (SARP) to the maximum extent possible. In the final rule, the FAA explained that its approach conforms with the ICAO SARPs to the maximum extent practicable and provides an equivalent level of safety that meets or exceeds the ICAO standards. This includes leveraging the ICAO-accepted definition of powered-lift and working with ICAO in the Advanced Air Mobility Study Group to ensure the regulatory gaps are identified and addressed in future ICAO Annexes.

PETE BUTTIGIEG, SECRETARY OF TRANSPOR- TATION, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, FROM HON. MIKE EZELL Question 1. Recently I introduced H.R. 8505 along with Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton to address the rampant fraud in the supply chain that is costing stakeholders and consumers likely over a billion dollars annually. While the Depart- ment of Transportation has jurisdiction over this issue, there are antiquated inter- nal systems and procedures at the Department of Transportation that inhibit progress. What strategy does the Department have in place to address rampant fraud in the supply chain? ANSWER. Though criminal actions are outside FMCSA’s regulatory authority, it is collaborating with other Federal agencies that may have sufficient authority and in- vestigatory resources to pursue freight theft and fraud cases where possible. For ex- ample, because FMCSA lacks criminal authority, it is required to refer suspected crimes such as fraud to the Department’s Office of Inspector General for further in- vestigation and potential criminal prosecution. FMCSA has been actively working with the Office of Inspector General, as well as other federal agencies, to identify ways to leverage resources to better address fraudulent activity. FMCSA formed an internal workgroup specifically targeted to work on issues in- volving broker oversight (including steps to address unlawful brokering) and compli- ance which FMCSA believes will assist in preventing fraud in motor carrier trans- portation. To address potential vulnerabilities in its Information Technology systems, FMCSA continues its work on modernizing its registration systems to improve the security of those systems. This is expected to significantly increase the ability of FMCSA to thoroughly verify the identity of registrants and the legitimacy of the businesses of motor carriers and brokers being registered. This will greatly aid FMCSA and the Department in closing pathways that criminal entities currently use to obtain operating authority and/or unlawfully use the identity of legitimate carriers and brokers for freight fraud and theft purposes. Question 2. What steps have you taken to improve infrastructure at land ports of entry to accommodate 21st-century trade across our nation’s northern and south- ern borders? ANSWER. DOT continues to cooperate with the Department of Homeland Security, the General Services Administration, the Department of State, and others to plan coordinated infrastructure investments and operations. This includes investments at 26 land ports of entry (LPOEs) which received funding via the Bipartisan Infra- structure Law (BIL) and support of the interagency Presidential Permitting process. The FHWA continues to co-chair the Joint Working Committee on Transportation Planning with the Government of Mexico, which drives the creation of ‘‘Border Mas- ter Plans’’ that U.S. southern border states developed in partnership with their Mexican state counterparts. These plans help U.S. states anticipate their use of Title 23, United States Code funding for future road infrastructure leading to LPOEs. Similarly, FHWA continues to co-chair the Transportation Border Working Group with the Government of Canada and leads the development of a Border Infra- structure Improvement Plan (BIIP). The BIIP helps U.S. states and Canadian prov- inces better understand current volume of operations across borders and plan for future requirements. The Department also continues to use its discretionary grant programs to advance its LPOE improvement goals. For example, on the FY24 INFRA Grant awards, DOT awarded $25 million to support repairs to the Alaska Highway, a corridor in the Canadian Yukon Territory leading to Alaska’s primary LPOE with Canada. In FY22, DOT awarded the largest INFRA grant that year—worth $150 million—to the San Diego Association of Governments to fund construction of the new Otay Mesa East LPOE. This LPOE will reduce wait times and allow more commercial vehicles to transit the U.S.-Mexico border with positive economic impacts for the region. DOT is also providing technical assistance support to 4 LPOEs through our Thriv- ing Communities Program. This includes helping these communities access federal funds for critical transportation projects in Douglas and San Luis, AZ; Brownsville, TX; and Sumas, WA, and to strengthen coordination with other federal agencies to support related investments needed in housing, economic development, and other types of infrastructure.

How the DOT evaluates and prioritizes the critical need for strategic seaports to support our military when ranking PIDP applications; ANSWER. The Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) announcing the availability of discretionary grant funding for the FY 2024 Port Infrastructure Development Pro- gram adds a definition of ‘‘strategic seaport’’ and clarifies, as provided in Section 3514 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024, that the De- partment may give priority to projects at strategic seaports in support of national security requirements. As provided for in the NOFO, we will consider the status of an applicant as a strategic seaport and the extent to which the project proposed by the applicant supports national security requirements in making PIDP grants. Question 3.b. What you have done to coordinate with the state of Mississippi’s agencies to prepare for the upcoming hurricane season; ANSWER. To prepare for this hurricane season, DOT’s Regional Emergency Trans- portation Representative (RETREP) for Region IV, which includes Mississippi, has taken several key steps. We conducted comprehensive Transportation training for our Regional Emergency Transportation Cadre (RET–C) in June and July to ensure their readiness for deployment. These highly trained experts are ready to be acti- vated during incidents. We are also coordinating with Mississippi state staff to up- date our contact list and discuss further collaboration. Additionally, we will continue utilizing established coordination calls to maintain real-time communication with Mississippi, and other states. Question 3.c. If DOT plans to mandate a forced phase in overtime of electric vehi- cles or continue to allow transit systems to determine what type of alternative fuel technologies work best for them; ANSWER. Local transit agencies identify and determine the type of propulsion sys- tem that best meets an agency’s and community’s needs. Question 3.d. Why you requested half of what you requested in FY 2024 for FY 2025 CRISI grants; and ANSWER. The Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 set government-wide discretionary budget caps for Fiscal Years 2024 and 2025. The target for FY 2024 was approxi- mately equal to FY 2023, and the FY 2025 target was 1 percent higher than FY 2024. In order to maintain investments in the Department’s critical safety mission and ensure implementation of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) was not hin- dered, the FY 2025 President’s Budget makes reductions to discretionary grant pro- grams that also receive funding under the BIL, including CRISI. The Department found that our appropriations committees made similar trade-offs in meeting the caps required for FY 2024 and the initial markups for the FY 2025 appropriations process. The FY 2025 President’s Budget requests $250 million for CRISI compared to the FY 2024 President’s Budget request for $510 million. The proposed reduction in FY 2025 should not be misconstrued as a lack of support for CRISI—or other highly successful and oversubscribed programs that also saw reduced requests—but rather a necessary trade-off under challenging budget conditions. The $250 million request for FY 2025 is also in addition to the $1 billion advance appropriation provided to CRISI under BIL, bringing the total proposed FY 2025 CRISI resources to $1.25 bil- lion. Question 3.e. What steps you are putting in place to assist state DOTs to allow ample time to obligate funds during the August redistribution. ANSWER. FHWA engaged in early and consistent outreach to states on August Re- distribution to help them plan for another large redistribution in FY 2024. In May 2024, FHWA notified states of their share of an updated estimate of $8.7 billion for the FY 2024 August Redistribution for planning purposes. FHWA has taken steps to speed up project delivery and is working to reduce the time it takes to process grant agreements from award announcement to obligation, including obligation of discretionary grant funds that are subject to obligation limi- tation. This will lower the amount of obligation limitation redistributed each fiscal year. FHWA Division Offices collaborated with State DOTs to identify potential projects, obligate discretionary grant funding, and utilize planning and program- ming flexibilities. Additionally, FHWA worked closely with FTA to determine transit capital activities that were ready for obligation as an option of transferring funds to FTA for eligible transit projects and coordinated with FTA to transfer funding late into September to provide maximum flexibility. For FY 2024, states requested approximately $9 billion of additional formula obligation limitation under August Redistribution, an amount that exceeded the amount of obligation limitation re- turned for redistribution. On August 27, 2024, FHWA successfully redistributed ap- VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00144 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN135 proximately $8.7 billion in obligation limitation to the states. The formal process for the next August Redistribution will commence in July 2025. QUESTION TO HON. PETE BUTTIGIEG, SECRETARY OF TRANSPOR- TATION, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, FROM HON. RICK LARSEN Question 1. Secretary Buttigieg, USDOT has played an essential leadership role in the development of sustainable aviation fuels through the SAF Grand Challenge. However, just as important is the development of sustainable maritime fuels, which need a whole of government approach to not only push forward on implementation but also to identify which of several zero-emission fuel alternatives will emerge as the leading option. How does USDOT see its role in a parallel ‘‘grand challenge’’ ef- fort on sustainable maritime fuels? ANSWER. Recognizing the maritime sector is comprised of various vessel sizes and engine requirements, multiple low carbon fuels and technologies will be required to meet decarbonization goals. For example, fuels that may work for a tugboat may not necessarily work for a large oceangoing vessel. Fuel research/development is pri- marily being conducted by the Department of Energy (DOE). At DOT, the Maritime Administration (MARAD) supports such research through the Maritime Environ- mental and Technical Assistance (META) program. Under META, MARAD has been partnering with the DOE and National Laboratories to test and demonstrate a range of low carbon, alternative fuels for various maritime vessel applications. Tan- gentially, along with identifying what fuels work for specific applications, other chal- lenges need to be addressed such as the availability of marine engines designed to use low carbon fuels, ample supply of low carbon fuels, and sufficient infrastructure. In addition to research, MARAD’s META program supports policy efforts such as the DOE-led Mission Innovation: Zero Emission Shipping Mission, multiple green corridor efforts, and representatives from the META program serve on the U.S. Del- egation to the International Maritime Organization. QUESTIONS TO HON. PETE BUTTIGIEG, SECRETARY OF TRANSPOR- TATION, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, FROM HON. STEVE COHEN Question 1. The bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) requires the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to finalize a rule for the Honoring Abbas Family Legacy to Terminate Drunk Driving (HALT) Act by No- vember of this year that would require technology that would passively detect illegal impairment, a provision that when implemented could save 10,000 lives per year. Is NHTSA on track to complete that rule by the deadline? ANSWER. NHTSA published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for Ad- vanced Impaired Driving Prevention Technology on January 5, 2024, and received more than 18,000 public comments. NHTSA is currently reviewing these comments. If the agency is unable to meet the rulemaking deadline, NHTSA will submit a re- port to Congress explaining (among other things) the reasons for not issuing a final rule, as required by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. NHTSA continues to evaluate technologies and their potential to detect alcohol- based driving impairment. Significant progress has been made on the development of vehicle systems to passively detect impairment, but they are not yet equipped on vehicles offered for sale to the public. Further, these technologies are not expected to be introduced into the new vehicle fleet until 2025 or after. NHTSA plans to evaluate the effectiveness of in-vehicle production systems, including potential unin- tended consequences, and develop minimum performance standards and test proce- dures pursuant to requirements of the Motor Vehicle Safety Act, prior to issuing a final rule. Question 2. In its Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM), NHTSA stated the need for personal privacy considerations that monitor driver behavior or condition. What additional information can you share that will ensure advanced impaired driving prevention technology will stop drunk driving, potentially saving 10,000 lives every year, while also protecting the privacy and data of individuals? ANSWER. NHTSA continues to consider the significant safety potential for im- paired driving prevention technology to passively and accurately detect drunk driv- ing, while also avoiding unintended safety consequences and protecting the privacy VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00145 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN136 and data of individuals. NHTSA received more than 18,000 public comments to the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for Advanced Impaired Driving Prevention Technology, published on January 5, 2024. The Agency is currently evaluating those comments, including those focused on privacy. Question 3. Some individuals have incorrectly stated that the rulemaking would require vehicles to have a ‘‘kill switch’’ that would allow law enforcement or third- party actors to remotely disable vehicles. The language in the bipartisan IIJA spe- cifically directs for the vehicle to prevent movement if ‘‘illegal impairment’’ of a driv- er is detected. Is it NHTSA’s intent to include in the final rulemaking a technology that would allow for such a kill switch? ANSWER. Section 24220 of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) directs NHTSA to issue a final rule establishing an FMVSS that requires new passenger vehicles to have ‘‘advanced drunk and impaired driving prevention technology.’’ IIJA defines this as technology that can passively monitor the performance of a driver of a motor vehicle to accurately identify whether that driver may be impaired and/or passively and accurately detect whether the blood alcohol concentration of a driver is above the figure specified in section 163(a) of title 23, United States Code (U.S.C.), and prevent or limit motor vehicle operation if such a detection is made. NHTSA is eval- uating the public comments received in response to the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, published on January 5, 2024, and will issue a proposal that will be open to public comment before a rule is finalized. QUESTIONS TO HON. PETE BUTTIGIEG, SECRETARY OF TRANSPOR- TATION, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, FROM HON. JOHN GARAMENDI Question 1. Mr. Secretary, I also want to draw your attention to yet another out- dated general waiver of ‘‘Buy America’’ requirements in your Department. Since 1978, Congress has required that all steel products used in projects funded by the Federal Highway Administration be sourced domestically, when available in suffi- cient quantity and of satisfactory quality. However, the Federal Highway Adminis- tration waived ‘‘Buy America’’ requirements for ferry boat equipment and machinery made from steel in 1994. Will you commit to examine this 1994 waiver of ‘‘Buy America’’ requirements for public ferry systems and consider repealing it? ANSWER. DOT and FHWA are committed to reviewing all of our existing general waivers, as required by section 70914(d) of the Build America, Buy America Act (BABA). Consistent with the direction provided by Congress in the BABA statute, we intend to review product-specific general applicability waivers, including the FHWA waiver for ferryboat parts that you mention, and determine what, if any, ac- tion is required. Question 2. In 2019, I worked with former Chairman DeFazio, Senator John Cor- nyn (R–TX), and others to shut out Chinese state-controlled enterprises that make rolling stock in mainland China and then reassemble knock-down kits in the United States from federal transit funding. With the China Railway Construction Corpora- tion (CRCC) and BYD bus maker now banned from receiving Federal Transit Ad- ministration dollars, I was concerned those Chinese rolling stock manufacturers could pivot to selling their low-quality railcars and buses to federally funded airport improvement projects. The bipartisan FAA Reauthorization signed into law by President Biden this past May included my ‘‘Airport Infrastructure Vehicle Security Act’’ (H.R.2912) with Congressman Eric Swalwell (D–CA14). This applied the stronger ‘‘Buy America’’ requirements for federal transit funding to rolling stock pro- cured with federal airport improvement grants. Mr. Secretary, will you ensure that the FAA fully enforces these stronger ‘‘Buy America’’ requirements for rolling stock, so that federally funded buses and trams at U.S. airports are made in the United States by skilled American workers and not by Chinese state-controlled enterprises? ANSWER. The Department takes its oversight role in the implementation of trans- portation laws seriously, and is currently working on executing the bipartisan FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024 that was signed into law this May. FAA is committed to enforcing the Airport Infrastructure Vehicle Security Act requirements for rolling stock that you cite.

PETE BUTTIGIEG, SECRETARY OF TRANSPOR- TATION, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, FROM HON. DINA TITUS Question 1. The Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada is my district’s public transit agency. It serves over 2.3 million residents and operates the 14th busiest bus system in the United States, transporting over 50 million pas- sengers last year. In order to enhance rider safety, they have adopted AI tech- nologies including for quickly detecting high-risk traffic incidents and integrating transit feeds for proactive service adjustments. Considering advancements in AI, does DOT have plans to support investments in similar technological solutions nationwide to increase rider safety and security? ANSWER. On August 9, 2023, FTA announced a grant for $500,000 under a cooper- ative agreement with the University of South Florida for a research project to help transit agencies address transit worker and rider assaults. The project will identify public safety risks for transit workers and riders, determine the most effective miti- gation strategies to minimize those risks, and promote the implementation of those strategies. FTA also continues to assess the utility of AI to address worker safety such as monitoring real-time video at transit stations. This will continue to be an area of research inquiry. QUESTIONS TO HON. PETE BUTTIGIEG, SECRETARY OF TRANSPOR- TATION, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, FROM HON. MARK DESAULNIER Question 1. Mr. Secretary, as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, my bill the Clean Corridors Act was passed and established the Charging and Fueling In- frastructure Grant Program. Can you share more on its implementation and how else we can support the expansion of electric vehicle charging across the country? ANSWER. On March 14, 2023, FHWA announced its Round 1 Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) for the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure (CFI) Discre- tionary Grant Program. This round of funding from fiscal years 2022 and 2023 was made available to strategically deploy electric vehicle (EV) charging and other alter- native fueling infrastructure projects in publicly accessible locations in urban and rural communities, as well as along designated Alternative Fuel Corridors (AFCs). On January 11, 2024, FHWA announced $623 million in grants under the CFI Pro- gram to help build out an EV charging network across the U.S., which will create American jobs and ensure more drivers can charge their EVs where they live, work, and shop. The awards will fund 47 EV charging and alternative-fueling infrastruc- ture projects in 22 States and Puerto Rico, including construction of approximately 7,500 EV charging ports. On August 27, 2024, FHWA announced $521 million in additional grants under the first round NOFO to fund the deployment of more than 9,200 EV charging ports across 29 States. On May 30, 2024, FHWA released its Round 2 NOFO for the CFI Program to so- licit applications. In addition, funds under the National Electric Vehicle Infrastruc- ture (NEVI) Formula Program 10 percent set-aside will also be awarded under this NOFO. The NOFO released on May 30, 2024, also announced FHWA’s intention to make additional awards for applications submitted under the Round 1 NOFO. Round 2 applications were due by September 11, 2024, and they are currently under review. Collectively, the NOFO issued on May 30, 2024, represents the largest sin- gle grant funding opportunity for EV charging in the nation’s history, making up to $1.3 billion available for projects that will accelerate public and private invest- ment in clean transportation. Question 2.a. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act also provided significant funding for renewable energy and fuel. This is expected to lead to a significant increase in jobs in clean energy in the next decade. How can we further support this funding to ensure the workforce gets the help they need to transition towards these new and expanding industry fields? ANSWER. DOT has prioritized the creation of good jobs and workforce training op- portunities in all of our funding vehicles. For the vast majority of programs, includ- ing those that are funding clean energy projects, applicants are asked to address how they are training their project workforce. As examples, DOT has also made it clear how FHWA formula funds can be used for workforce development, as well as CRISI grants and FTA low/no bus facilities programs.

Transportation agencies are taking advantage of these opportunities. Several states, including California, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, have an- nounced new ways to use FHWA funding for workforce development. Each year more funding has been spent from CRISI grants on workforce development. The FTA low/no bus and bus facilities program has heavily encouraged applicants to take full advantage of the 5 percent set aside, leading to $140 million dedicated to workforce development in this program alone. Question 2.b. In particular, I have heard that due to the mass layoffs and early retirements during the Trump Administration, many agencies are still understaffed. How can we help support these agencies, in addition to understaffing at the state and local levels, that might slow rollout of funding or implementation of new policy programs? ANSWER. Since the passing of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Department of Transportation has steadily increased its hiring and onboard strength, with over 5,600 employees hired in Fiscal Year (FY) 2024. In fact, at the end of FY 2024 DOT had more than 57,000 employees, the most it has had in over 10 years. At the Oper- ating Administration (OA) level, all OAs saw an increase in the number of employ- ees onboard in FY 2024 as compared to FY 2023. QUESTIONS TO HON. PETE BUTTIGIEG, SECRETARY OF TRANSPOR- TATION, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, FROM HON. GREG STANTON Question 1. Secretary Buttigieg, section 912 of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024 requires the Office of the Secretary to, not later than 270 days after enact- ment, establish a Department of Transportation program to provide competitive grants to state, local and tribal governments to use small drones to help address the backlog in critical infrastructure inspections in the United States. This language enjoyed bipartisan support in both the House and Senate and will help make critical infrastructure inspections safer for workers and more efficient for the users of the critical infrastructure. What steps has the USDOT taken to establish the Drone Infrastructure Inspec- tion Grant (DIIG) program and will you commit to this Committee to meet or exceed the statutory deadline to establish the DIIG program? ANSWER. Infrastructure inspection using safe and reliable, domestically produced drones presents a way to better ensure the safety and stability of the national infra- structure and to enable economic benefits of drones. These inspections can and do happen across the country today under 14 CFR Part 107 line of sight operations. The Department has Part 107 licensed pilots using drones to inspect critical high- way infrastructure. The Department appreciates Congress’ support in developing this capability through provisions in the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024 (Pub. L. 118–63, May 16, 2024) that would enable the FAA to inspect its own infrastructure and a manage grant program for state governments to establish their own drone in- spection programs. While this new program introduces important requirements, it has not yet received appropriations sufficient to fully implement them. We look for- ward to collaborating with Congress to ensure that adequate funding is secured for all new programs mandated by the Reauthorization. The Department is fully com- mitted to meeting the legislative requirements for this and all provisions of the FAA Reauthorization. We are currently developing a management strategy that will allow us to implement the infrastructure inspection program to the best of our abil- ity, despite competing priorities and financial constraints. Question 2. Mr. Secretary, I advanced two Arizonans, including a tribal member, to serve on the working group for covered resources created by my ROCKS Act. Included in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) was bipartisan legislation, the ROCKS Act, I led that establishes a working group at DOT to examine and draft policies to ensure we have sustainable access to construction materials. My home state of Arizona has led the way in enacting such policies that keep prices low and ensure more sustainable options are available as we work to build the in- frastructure funded by the BIL. I understand the list of individuals to serve on the group is pending your review. When can we expect the members of this group to be named? ANSWER. FHWA published a notice in the Federal Register soliciting membership to the Working Group on January 9, 2024. The deadline for nominations was March 11, 2024. We are currently reviewing the nominations in accordance with section 11526 of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Federal Advisory Committee Act VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00148 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN139 (chapter 10 of title 5, United States Code), and the published notice.

I want to commend you on your recent budget proposal which con- tained $8 billion over 5 years in additional guaranteed Trust Fund spending for Federal Aviation Administration facilities and equipment. As you know, other pro- grams, like surface Transportation Contract Authority, the Harbor Maintenance Fund and the Airport Improvement Program already have this authority. Can you describe why this proposal is critical to maintain and upgrading the Federal Avia- tion Administration’s aging facilities? ANSWER. The FAA shoulders the crucial responsibility of overseeing the infra- structure of a vast network of nearly 350 air traffic control towers (ATCT) and ter- minal radar approach control (TRACON) facilities, in addition to managing 21 air route traffic control centers (ARTCC). Re-capitalization is necessary to sustain safe and efficient National Airspace System (NAS) operations in the decades to come. A failure to replace facilities and modernize radar networks in a timely manner will degrade FAA’s capacity to keep pace with the aviation economy and undermine op- portunities to improve safety. Facilities: The FAA confronts a pressing challenge—aging buildings. Air traffic control facilities have chronic issues that cannot be resolved through maintenance or sustainment work. These issues include water leaks, mold, tower cab window con- densation, deterioration due to old designs, and general disrepair. Drivers for re- placement include material degradation; deficiencies in building code compliance; and poor insulation and energy efficiency. As the age of these facilities continues to rise, these types of issues will grow exponentially. Air traffic controllers must have safe and secure towers to effectively manage and ensure the safety of air traf- fic. Replacement of these structures will provide the new standard in construction, health, safety, and operational efficiency. Many of the FAA’s facilities are large and complex, often requiring expensive and lengthy replacement efforts. Due to their size, costs are typically spread out across multiple fiscal years and the instability of annual appropriations can make it dif- ficult to commit funding to such projects. By proposing a new stream of funding over the next five years, the FAA’s proposal offers an opportunity to replace at least 20 of these aging facilities. Radar Systems: The FAA’s plan also focuses on the timely and strategic mod- ernization of surveillance radars. Airports use these radars to detect and display the presence and position of aircraft in the terminal area as well as the airspace around airports. The aging radars pose a significant challenge for air traffic management. As these radar systems age, they are more prone to technological obsolescence, mak- ing it increasingly difficult to maintain their performance and integrate them with modern aviation infrastructure. The potential for increased downtime due to repairs can negatively impact airport operations and compromise the efficiency of air traffic control. Moreover, aging radar systems struggle to keep pace with the growing de- mands of air travel and evolving regulatory standards. To address these challenges, this plan invests in the replacement of radars opting for new technologies that offer improved performance, enhanced reliability, and compatibility with the latest air traffic management initiatives. The FAA maintains 618 radar systems across the nation. These systems, deployed across many decades, are a critical tool used by air traffic controllers to safely and efficiently manage air traffic. Modern aviation could not exist without these radar systems. In addition to the re-capitalization of air traffic control facilities discussed above, this proposal will allow the FAA to replace and modernize 60 percent of its radars by 2031. FAA radar systems provide safety critical information to air traffic controllers, in- cluding an aircraft’s position and identity as well as weather information. FAA radar systems provide a backup to Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast in- formation, providing essential information in the event of Global Positioning System (GPS) degradation. This information is also essential for homeland security and na- tional defense missions. As FAA radar systems exceed their intended lifespan, out- ages increase in frequency and duration, and service restoration becomes more dif- ficult as antiquated components become increasingly difficult to obtain. The absence of critical aircraft position and identity information increases the risk of airborne VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00149 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN140 collision and results in increased separation requirements, reducing operational effi- ciency. Question 2. One of FAA’s most successful and cost-effective government/industry partnerships for taxpayers is the FAA Contract Tower Program. There are 264 air- ports in the program, including New Century AirCenter and Johnson County Execu- tive Airport in my district. This critical air traffic safety program supports general aviation operations, U.S. Department of Defense flight training operations and mili- tary readiness, commercial air service, and flight schools across the country. Con- tract towers continue to get high marks from the U.S. Department of Transportation Inspector General and aviation users and have strong bipartisan support. It’s also important to note that contract towers account for approximately one third of all tower operations and about 70 percent of contract controllers are veterans. Question 2.a. Can you describe the what priority contract towers have for the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administration going for- ward? ANSWER. The FAA remains committed to ensuring the continued success of the Contract Tower Program. The FAA will continue to work with stakeholders to strengthen communication and enhance transparency to achieve mutual benefits. Question 2.b. Staffing shortages also continue to be a challenge throughout the industry, including contract towers. What measures can we in government, the Fed- eral Aviation Administration, and the industry undertake to address staffing chal- lenges at these towers in a collaborative way? ANSWER. Air traffic controller staffing shortages are at the forefront of discussions in the FAA. The FAA exceeded its goal of hiring 1,800 air traffic controllers in 2024, with a final total of 1,811 for Fiscal Year 2024. As the largest number of hires in nearly a decade, this marks important progress in the FAA’s work to reverse the decades-long air traffic controller staffing level decline. Staffing remains a priority for the FAA, and we are actively working on ways to sustain it to maintain the safety of the operation. The FAA has met with industry leaders to discuss possible solutions and is committed to exploring all available op- tions to ensure the continued success of the FAA Contract Tower Program. With the launch of the Enhanced Air Traffic Collegiate Training Initiative (E– CTI), the FAA instituted changes to FAA Order JO7210.3, which allows Federal Contract Towers (FCTs) to hire individuals who have graduated with an E–CTI en- dorsement. This is a new hiring pathway for FCTs that currently only hire control- lers with previous experience in the FAA or military. E–CTI graduates are trainees with no previous experience, thus FCTs will need to provide more robust field quali- fication training in accordance with FAA Order JO3120.4. Question 3.a. As you are likely aware, I have worked for years, along with other members of the House, to expedite the installation of new and updated navaid sys- tems throughout the National Airspace. Can you please provide an update on the Federal Aviation Administration’s schedule for deploying these devices? ANSWER. The FAA deploys new and updated navigation aid systems such as the Instrument Landing System (ILS) and Medium Intensity Approach Lighting System with Runway Alignment Indicator Lights (MALSR). The FAA has been able to uti- lize a combination of Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Landing and Lighting Port- folio funding to greatly increase the amount of installation projects under the ILS Program and MALSR Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) compared to previous years. For ILS installations, there are currently 20 active projects planned to be com- pleted by 2030, with 7 projects expected to be completed in the rest of CY2024. For installations under the MALSR SLEP, there are currently 20 active projects planned to be completed by 2030, with 7 projects expected to be completed in the rest of CY2024. Question 3.b. As you may be aware, the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists have a proposed pilot program for deploying these systems in 18 months. To your knowledge, is the Federal Aviation Administration considering this proposal? ANSWER. The FAA is considering the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists’ (PASS) proposal. The FAA’s Program Management Organization and Technical Op- erations are coordinating with PASS regarding the proposed pilot program. Question 3.c. Can you share with the committee why you have confidence in the Department’s current plan, and why you believe that these systems, which are al- ready functionally obsolete, will be able to reliably provide a safety-critical service when they are 100 years old? VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00150 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN141 ANSWER. There are no Instrument Landing System (ILS) systems in the NAS any- where near 100 years old. The FAA acknowledges the aging navigation aid infra- structure; however, the agency has a navigation strategy designed to replace the older systems first with the existing ILS Contract. The FAA has begun to replace systems with modern ILS–420 technology. The FAA also acknowledges the aging Medium Intensity Approach Lighting Sys- tem with Runway Alignment Indicator Lights (MALSR) infrastructure, which is being addressed through the MALSR Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) to re- place obsolete components. The FAA is prioritizing MALSR configurations for the SLEP that are experiencing the greatest obsolescence and cost impact on the NAS. Question 4. As you are likely aware, cargo theft is increasingly an issue through- out the supply chain, especially for trucking and rail shippers. The average cost of each stolen shipment can exceed $280,000, but these thefts result in millions of dol- lars in financial losses to large and small manufacturers, retailers and shippers, both in lost product and the intentional and unintentional sale of stolen goods through legitimate markets. Question 4.a. To what extend is the U.S. Department of Transportation aware of these increased rates of theft across the transportation supply chain network? ANSWER. The Department has heard from concerned rail and truck shippers that increasing rates of theft are impacting their operations and resulting in increased costs, both in terms of lost goods and reduced efficiency from having to modify their operations in response. Question 4.b. Can you elaborate on how the Department is coordinating with rel- evant agencies and affected stakeholders to ensure continued cargo theft doesn’t continue to affect consumer costs? ANSWER. Though criminal actions are outside FMCSA’s regulatory authority, it is collaborating with other Federal agencies that may have sufficient authority and in- vestigatory resources to pursue freight theft and fraud cases where possible. For ex- ample, because FMCSA lacks criminal authority, it is required to refer suspected crimes such as fraud to the Department’s Office of Inspector General for further in- vestigation and potential criminal prosecution. FMCSA has been actively working with the Office of Inspector General, as well as other federal agencies, to identify ways to leverage resources to better address fraudulent activity. FMCSA formed an internal workgroup specifically targeted to work on issues in- volving broker oversight (including steps to address unlawful brokering) and compli- ance which FMCSA believes will assist in preventing fraud in motor carrier trans- portation. To address potential vulnerabilities in its Information Technology systems, FMCSA continues its work on modernizing its registration systems to improve the security of those systems. This is expected to significantly increase the ability of FMCSA to thoroughly verify the identity of registrants and the legitimacy of the businesses of motor carriers and brokers being registered. This will greatly aid FMCSA and the Department in closing pathways that criminal entities currently use to obtain operating authority and/or unlawfully use the identity of legitimate carriers and brokers for freight fraud and theft purposes. Question 5.a. As you may be aware, the U.S. is hosting games as a part of the FIFA 2026 World Cup. To what extent is the U.S. Department of Transportation involved in the coordination with U.S. host cities in preparation for the influx of visitors our country will host? ANSWER. DOT is actively working with Federal partners and stakeholders as part of the White House-led whole-of-government effort to coordinate successful ‘‘Global Sports’’ events like the World Cup. The Department is interested in doing all we can to make sure that America’s hosting is smooth and successful. DOT has formed an internal working group to better coordinate among our operating administrations and is participating in regular meetings with FIFA and host city organizers to co- ordinate on international, intercity, and intracity transportation. Question 5.b. To what extent, if any, have local partners communicated potential needs to the Department? ANSWER. During meetings with FIFA and host cities in 2024, DOT has heard from organizers and local stakeholders about their priorities and plans for delivering a successful World Cup. In July 2024, DOT organized three regional convenings be- tween DOT, FIFA, and the 11 U.S. cities that FIFA has grouped into the West, Cen- tral, and East North American regions for the 2026 World Cup. Some host cities have requested and held individual meetings with DOT to discuss their potential needs and priorities. Through all of these engagements, DOT has been offering reg- VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00151 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN142 ular coordination, technical assistance for federal projects, and referral to existing DOT discretionary grants and formula funding sources. QUESTIONS TO HON. PETE BUTTIGIEG, SECRETARY OF TRANSPOR- TATION, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, FROM HON. CHRIS PAPPAS Question 1. There were more than 160,000 large truck crashes nationwide in 2022, with more than 5,000 of these occurring in my state of New Hampshire. We know that one of the leading causes of large truck crashes is driver fatigue, yet truckers are often forced to continue driving beyond their allowed hours of service or park in unsafe locations along the highway due to a shortage of safe and acces- sible truck parking. In fact, 70% of drivers report having been forced to violate fed- eral hours of service rules due to the lack of truck parking. Increasing access to truck parking would support workforce recruitment and re- tention and improve supply chain connectivity while making our roadways safer. While I understand that the Federal Highway Administration is seeking to conduct its third nationwide Jason’s Law truck parking survey to evaluate truck parking op- tions, how else is the Department planning to address the shortage of truck parking nationwide? ANSWER. FHWA released the Truck Parking Development Handbook in Sep- tember 2022 to help states and localities consider truck parking needs and to design safe truck parking projects that will benefit drivers and local communities. DOT also convened a meeting of the National Coalition on Truck Parking in the fall of 2022 to highlight these opportunities and best practices in truck parking. FHWA convened another meeting of the National Coalition on Truck Parking in December 2023. The workshop focused on DOT modal commitments towards reducing our Na- tion’s truck parking shortage and improving safety. DOT continues to raise the need for public investment in truck parking and has supported it by selecting truck park- ing projects for discretionary funding. FHWA also continues to facilitate truck parking workshops for states, State Freight Advisory Committees, metropolitan planning organizations, and corridor coalitions across the country to support collaboration on solutions to address truck parking issues. FHWA has a free National Highway Institute Truck Parking Train- ing Course (FHWA–NHI–139014 1) available. The course is designed for a broad range of stakeholders, including planners, managers, and analysts within a public sector transportation agency such as a State DOT or metropolitan/regional planning organization as well as locally elected administrators, economic development offi- cials and terminal operators such as air cargo and marine ports. Others who may benefit from the course include private sector personnel (e.g., truck stop operators, private industry truck stop operators, motor carriers and state trucking associa- tions). The Office of Multimodal Freight Infrastructure and Policy and FHWA are coordi- nating on the review and approval of State Freight Plans, which now must include analysis of truck parking needs as required under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. FHWA guidance makes clear that National Highway Freight Program (NHFP) and other Federal-aid highway program funds can be used for truck parking projects. However, states, in collaboration with State Freight Advisory Committees (where they have been stood up), decide whether to use NHFP funding for truck parking or any other eligible project. Question 2. While the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act authorized grants to support truck parking projects, these funds aren’t exclusively dedicated to that purpose. States are now forced to make difficult choices between truck parking and critical infrastructure projects. How else can the Department support states looking to submit applications for truck parking grants to increase their likelihood of success? ANSWER. FHWA coordinates with FMCSA, MARAD, FRA, the Office of Multimodal Freight Infrastructure and Policy, and the Office of the Secretary to pro- mote the use of Federal-aid highway funding and discretionary grant funding for public sector applicants to develop truck parking projects. Guidance on eligible fund- ing was released in September 2022, widely distributed, and posted to the FHWA website through a memorandum on the Eligibility of Title 23 and Title 49 Federal 1 https://www.nhi.fhwa.dot.gov/course-search?tab=0&key=truck%20parking&sf=0&coursel no=139014 VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00152 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN143 Funds for Commercial Motor Vehicle Parking.2 The Department encourages states to develop a plan outlining existing safety risks around the shortage of truck park- ing and identifying strategies to improve commercial driver safety through the ex- pansion of truck parking facilities in their State. The DOT Navigator 3 is another new resource to help communities understand the best ways to apply for grants, and to plan for and deliver transformative infrastruc- ture projects and services, and the DOT Discretionary Grants Dashboard 4 helps communities identify discretionary grant opportunities that can aid in meeting their transportation infrastructure needs. FMCSA has a Grants Resource Center 5 to search for trainings, guidance, tools, and more. DOT and its modal administrations take every opportunity to publicize the use of grants for truck parking projects and to demonstrate how states and other recipi- ents are using these funds for truck parking to encourage others who may be inter- ested to replicate or make use of the grants as well. For example, FMCSA funds truck parking information systems and research through its HP–CMV and HP–ITD grants and has been working with recipients like states and universities to highlight the projects for other states and stakeholders via forums such as the Transportation Research Board, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Of- ficials, HP–ITD Program Manager Meetings, the National Coalition on Truck Park- ing, and other meetings. This has helped demonstrate to other states, for example, how to use the funding for truck parking successfully. Question 3. Thank you for your comments during last month’s hearing on the End DWI Act and the importance of ignition interlock devices. These public safety de- vices currently must be authorized by state law and are required by 24 states and the District of Columbia to prevent repeat offenders. NHTSA and the CDC recognize ignition interlocks as one of the most effective countermeasures to prevent impaired driving. As you know, this technology is distinct from the Advanced Impaired Driving Technology that the DOT recently completed a federal rulemaking on. With the knowledge that the rulemaking process for the Advanced Impaired Driv- ing Technology is still ongoing, does DOT plan to address this urgent safety issue in the short term by utilizing ignition interlock devices? ANSWER. Currently, ignition interlock devices are after-market devices installed in a motor vehicle to prevent a driver from operating the vehicle if the driver has been drinking. While NHTSA’s existing authorities preclude regulation of after-market devices, to date, all states have enacted legislation that either require or permit courts to order the use of breath alcohol ignition interlock devices for individuals convicted of driving under the influence. NHTSA conducted research into performance-based interlocks designed to prevent a drunk driver from starting the vehicle. To assist states in their administration of interlock programs, NHTSA published guidelines that include model specifications for interlock devices. NHTSA has also published an ignition interlock toolkit, a pro- gram guide on key features for ignition interlock programs, and various case studies and evaluation reports. QUESTIONS TO HON. PETE BUTTIGIEG, SECRETARY OF TRANSPOR- TATION, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, FROM HON. MARILYN STRICKLAND Question 1. I appreciate that the Department of Transportation earlier this year designated Cascadia under its Corridor ID program to support the project’s develop- ment. At the time of the award, Federal Railroad Administrator Bose said this pro- gram would provide the necessary tools to advance the project. Since the beginning of the year, the Washington State Department of Transportation and the Federal Railroad Administration have been working collaboratively towards an award for project planning development. The Washington State Department of Transportation is ready to move into Step 2 of the program, however, reaching agreement on the scope of work and funding amount is taking too long. 2 https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/freight/infrastructure/trucklparking/title23fundscmv/title23l 49lfundslcmv.pdf 3 https://www.transportation.gov/dot-navigator 4 https://www.transportation.gov/grants/dashboard 5 https://ai.fmcsa.dot.gov/Grants/ResourceCenter VerDate Aug 31 2005 07:56 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00153 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 P:\\HEARINGS\\118\\FULL\\6-27-2024_58381\\TRANSCRIPT\\58381.TXT JEAN144 Can you give me your commitment to work with me to make sure my state re- ceives the support it needs from the Federal Railroad Administration and the De- partment of Transportation to ensure the project can continue to move forward? ANSWER. Yes. The U.S. Department of Transportation and Federal Railroad Ad- ministration have been, and are committed to continuing, working with the Wash- ington State Department of Transportation at both the staff and senior leadership levels towards advancing this important project into Step 2 of the program, which is completion of the Service Development Plan (SDP). Upon successful completion of a SDP and dependent on funding availability, corridor sponsors may then enter into grant agreements for environmental review and preliminary engineering for projects identified in the corridor’s SDP. Question 2. In the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Senate Ap- propriations Report Language, there was language about Transportation Demand Management (TDM) asking the Federal Highway Administration to provide guid- ance on (1) TDM strategies are eligible for Federal-aid highway funds, (2) ways to develop best practices, and (3) additional technical assistance to State Department of Transportation, Metropolitan Planning Organizations, and local governments to incentivize the use of TDM. Will the Department of Transportation use its authority to act on this report lan- guage regarding TDM? ANSWER. DOT is advancing the development of guidance, planning, case studies, and research in the application and design of active transportation and demand management (ATDM) approaches. In addition, FHWA’s ATDM program provides lessons learned, standards, and best practices on key underlying ATDM planning, evaluation, analysis techniques and design elements that serve as a foundation for ATDM implementation. FHWA also provides technical assistance to make aware and inform State and local planning and transportation entities about various TDM strategies that may address safety and mobility performance when evaluating trans- portation improvements. QUESTIONS TO HON. PETE BUTTIGIEG, SECRETARY OF TRANSPOR- TATION, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, FROM HON. TROY A. CARTER Question 1. Mr. Secretary, I want to thank you for the historic infrastructure in- vestments made in southeast Louisiana from the Department of Transportation through programs funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, including: • $300 million to the Port of New Orleans for construction of a new container ter- minal • $178 million award to re-establish passenger rail from New Orleans toMobile for the first time since Hurricane Katrina damaged the line nearly 20years ago • Over $100 million total to the New Orleans Regional Transit Authority to con- struct a new downtown transit center, a new passenger ferry terminal, andnew electric buses and charging infrastructure, and • Over $20 million to design and construct train stations in Baton Rouge and Gonzales to advance passenger rail in south Louisiana. These investments, among many other Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funded projects, will be transformational for my district in helping us reduce our air pollu- tion, increase our resilience to the impacts of the climate crisis, and create good- paying clean energy jobs. I also want to commend you and the Department of Transportation for your trans- parency, including keeping a public calendar of upcoming funding opportunities and reviewing proposals and providing feedback to applicants after funding decisions are made. I mentioned earlier that the Port of New Orleans was awarded $300 million to support the construction of a new state-of-the-art container terminal. Recently, how- ever, it has been brought to my attention there are concerns regarding cost in- creases due to proposed tariffs on ship-to-shore cranes and other cargo handling equipment. While I fully support the Administration’s efforts to incentivize and create a do- mestic manufacturing base for cargo handling equipment—which is currently either non-existent or very limited—a new tariff, if implemented improperly could have a substantial negative impact on ports’ abilities to meet growing cargo demand at their terminals.

ANSWER. DOT supports the Administration’s efforts to curb unfair trade practices in China in strategic industries such as the manufacturing of Ship-to-Shore cranes. We will assist the Committee and Port community as best we can while industry adjusts to any tariff impacts. Question 2. Another project of significance for my region is the West Bank Rail Realignment project, which will add a new connecting segment to an existing freight rail line, shortening the total length of the corridor and moving freight train traffic from the existing corridor, in the middle of residential Gretna, Louisiana. Local offi- cials have tried to relocate these tracks for nearly two decades, and the situation is more dire now that LNG development in neighboring Plaquemines Parish will in- crease train traffic through the area. Question 2.a. Though the City of Gretna and its public and private partners have identified matching funds, this project needs a strong federal commitment to ensure its completion. Can you commit the Department to continue to work with the City of Gretna to find funding to make this project a reality? ANSWER. In April 2023, FRA’s Deputy Administrator personally visited the site in Gretna with FRA staff to learn more about the project. FRA and DOT staff are available to assist potential and past applicants who may seek funding under FRA or DOT grant programs. Prior to publication of a NOFO, FRA and DOT staff are available to meet with potential applicants, upon request, to provide technical assistance on project and program eligibility. Due to the de- mand for federal funding under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, some worthy projects may not be selected. If an applicant is not selected for funding under a NOFO for a FRA or DOT discretionary grant, the applicant may request a debrief after selections are announced. During a requested debrief, the applicant will have the opportunity to learn how they may improve their application for a future NOFO. I would also direct applicants to the Department’s DOT Navigator tool; a resource to help communities understand not only how to apply for grants, but also which grant opportunities best fit their needs. The DOT Discretionary Grants Dashboard also provides an overview of the Department’s grant opportunities, as well as other federal grant programs that may be of interest to rural communities. Question 2.b. The City of Gretna and their partners have applied for several dif- ferent DOT programs, including INFRA, CRISI, and Reconnecting Communities without success. They currently have a CRISI grant pending with FRA. What other funding opportunities should they pursue for this project? Do you have any advice for the project to get over the finish line utilizing federal funds? ANSWER. See response above. QUESTION TO HON. PETE BUTTIGIEG, SECRETARY OF TRANSPOR- TATION, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, FROM HON. ROB- ERT MENENDEZ Question 1. The ability for drone operators to conduct beyond visual line of sight (‘‘BVLOS’’) operations holds promise in addressing critical challenges, such as reduc- ing traffic congestion and lowering carbon emissions. In the bipartisan FAA Reau- thorization Act of 2024, which was signed into law May 16, 2024, Congress provided direction to the FAA to publish a draft BVLOS rule within 4 months of enactment and a final rule 16 months thereafter. Working with my colleague Rep. Rudy Yakym in introducing H.R. 3459, the Increasing Competitiveness for American Drones Act, we successfully advocated for the inclusion of language addressing BVLOS in the FAA bill and I have been a strong proponent of the FAA making this rulemaking a priority. Can you provide an update on the status of the BVLOS rule and any challenges you anticipate in being able to meet the Congressionally-mandated dead- line? ANSWER. The FAA is working to publish the notice of proposed rulemaking, ‘‘Nor- malizing Unmanned Aircraft Systems Beyond Visual Line of Sight Operations,’’ which is expected to expedite the introduction of BVLOS operations. In the mean- time, the FAA has streamlined approval processes for BVLOS operations approved through waivers or exemptions and is working to exercise the flexibility provided in the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024 to enable more scalable BVLOS operations in advance of rulemaking.

PETE BUTTIGIEG, SECRETARY OF TRANSPOR- TATION, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, FROM HON. HIL- LARY J. SCHOLTEN Question 1. As you know, Federal Transit Administration (FTA) regulations re- quire that transit agencies conduct alcohol and drug testing for their vehicle opera- tors. Those regulations also task agencies to use facilities certified by the Depart- ment of Health and Human Services (HHS) for oral testing. However, HHS has yet to certify a single facility for such testing. Can you provide an update on when HHS will certify facilities for alcohol and drug testing? Many agencies in states where marijuana use is legal—including Michigan—are struggling to oversee the timely and accurate testing of their employees, exacerbating the labor shortage in the tran- sit industry. Thanks in advance for your thoughtful response. ANSWER. Like with the other DOT operating administrations (FMCSA, FAA, FRA, PHMSA), FTA-regulated employers are required to utilize HHS-certified labora- tories to comply with DOT’s drug testing regulations. DOT defers to HHS on pro- viding an update on the certification of laboratories to administer oral fluid testing protocols. However, please be assured that HHS-certified urine drug testing labora- tories are providing timely and accurate testing and results to DOT-regulated em- ployers and that HHS is actively working with laboratories to bring oral fluid test- ing online. QUESTION TO HON. PETE BUTTIGIEG, SECRETARY OF TRANSPOR- TATION, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, FROM HON. CHRISTOPHER R. DELUZIO Question 1. One of the best ways to prevent derailments is with inspections, like those done by the IBEW workers in Western Pennsylvania. What is the Department of Transportation and the Federal Railroad Administration doing to ensure that the Class I railroads are properly inspecting and maintaining locomotives and rail cars? ANSWER. Railroads are required to operate trains in compliance with Federal safe- ty standards, and are expected to have inspection, testing, and maintenance pro- grams to ensure compliance with those standards. FRA monitors railroads for com- pliance with Federal safety requirements and pursues enforcement action as nec- essary to ensure compliance. FRA’s enforcement tools include civil penalties, special notices for repairs to remove cars from service, and orders directing compliance with any or all of the safety standards covering railroad or hazardous materials transpor- tation safety. FRA continues to push railroads to improve railroad safety through its traditional enforcement and oversight activities. In the form of inspection and audits, FRA con- ducts assessments of railroads’ safety culture, as well as systemwide audits of rail- road operations and focused inspections of equipment and infrastructure as appro- priate, including identifying any deficiencies in railroads’ inspection, testing, and maintenance programs. In October 2024, FRA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that seeks to enhance railroad track safety by requiring certain railroads to supplement visual inspections by operating a Track Geometry Measurement System (TGMS) at specified minimum frequencies on certain types of track. TGMS technology, devel- oped through an FRA-led research effort in collaboration with the rail industry, has been proven to quickly and accurately detect small changes in track geometry, and this proposed rulemaking will codify a standard for TGMS inspection frequencies to ensure that railroads live up to their safety responsibilities, now and in the future. Among other measures, FRA also issues Safety Advisories making recommenda- tions to the railroad industry, as well as more-immediate safety bulletins that de- scribe circumstances and facts related to recent accidents/incidents that can be shared throughout the industry at job briefings and safety stand-downs. In evalu- ating the railroads’ response to these recommendations, FRA speaks with railroad employees to learn if the railroads have responded effectively, and FRA will take additional action if deemed necessary.

The subcommittees met, pursuant to notice, at 2:04 p.m., in room 360, Cannon House Office Building, Hon. Dan Bishop (Chairman of the subcommittee) presiding. Present: Representatives Bishop, Ezell, Strong, Ivey, Ramirez, and Clarke. Also present: Representative Higgins, Pfluger, and Suozzi. Chairman BISHOP. The Committee on Homeland Security Sub- committee on Oversight, Investigations, and Accountability will come to order. Without objection, the Chair is authorized to declare the committee in recess at any point. The purpose of today’s hearing is to investigate the recent influx of inadmissible migrants from the People’s Republic of China to the United States borders. Without objection, the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Pfluger; the gentleman from Louisiana, Mr. Higgins; and the gentleman from New York, Mr. Suozzi, are permitted to sit on the dais and ask questions of the witnesses. I now recognize myself for an opening statement. Today’s sub- committee hearing will examine the unprecedented numbers of Chinese foreign nationals crossing the border and whether this rep- resents a risk to homeland security. I think we have a visual. There it is. Border Patrol records show that from 2007 to 2021, encounters of Chinese nationals illegally entering the United States at the Southwest Border were relatively rare, averaging a little over 1,000 per year. That changed dramatically under the Biden administra- tion, rising from 1,970 in fiscal year 2022 to 24,048 in fiscal year 2023, an 1,100 percent increase. In the last 7 months, from October to April, Border Patrol has already encountered 27,496 Chinese nationals, shattering last year’s total. At this pace, the full fiscal year will see encounters of illegal Chinese immigrants 2,300 percent higher than the rate just 2 years ago. This is a national security concern and it is not a new one. One year ago, the current Border Patrol Chief and then-Del Rio Sector Chief Jason Owens testified in a transcribed interview with (1)2 the committee that, ‘‘Even without the increase, people coming from the PRC would be of concern to me. That is always going to be a group we look at more closely and work with our partners, with FBI, to make sure they don’t pose a threat.’’ I agree that there is a serious national security concern and we should be looking closely at individuals coming from Communist China, the United States’ greatest adversary on the world stage. Unfortunately, under the Biden administration, Border Patrol agents have been instructed that when processing Chinese nation- als they should conduct short, basic interviews that include only generic background questions instead of in-depth interviews. In other words, there is no serious vetting. These questions simply ask about military service, education, birthplace in China, employment, and political affiliation with the CCP, while agents only proceed to an in-depth interview if one of the answers in the basic interview is flagged. It begs the question, how likely is it that someone showing up at the border is going to admit that they are here to do the bidding of the Chinese Com- munist Party or perhaps the People’s Liberation Army? Instead, that person will likely provide the answers their smug- glers told them to give Border Patrol. Just give the right answers and come right on into the homeland. These limited interviews, combined with a lack of reliable infor- mation from China to verify biographical claims and limited trans- lation services, severely constrain CBP’s ability to conduct rigorous vetting for criminal and national security concerns. One Border Patrol sector chief told the committee that it could be difficult to determine the motives of those detained who come from distant countries like China stating that, ‘‘We try our best to figure out why they are coming but, of course, that information can be hidden, their agendas, their ideologies. The reason for them coming could be missed.’’ This is especially true for got-aways, those who avoid apprehen- sion and who reportedly pay as much as $60,000 to be smuggled illegally into the United States. Some of you may have seen some news made, I think just yesterday, finally a document emerging verifying that the number of got-aways in total is quite large, I think about 1.7 million, if I remember correctly, across the Biden administration. But among them presumably there are some num- ber of Chinese nationals, if the numbers that are showing up at the Southwest Border is any indication. The Government has no idea who the got-aways are or why they are crossing the border and deliberately trying to avoid Border Pa- trol. But something tells me the motive isn’t likely to be above board. Some Chinese nationals may be motivated to seek asylum on le- gitimate claims of persecution, such as Uyghurs from Shenzhen, but it is more likely that they come for economic reasons or other motives that do not meet the statutory requirements for asylum. Considering the Biden administration’s failure to hold China to ac- count, these Chinese nationals also know that it is very unlikely they will ever be returned to China under this administration’s policies, even if ordered removed by an immigration judge.3 Some Chinese nationals may have more nefarious motives for coming to the United States. For example, Federal indictments in North Carolina from last month show partnerships between Mexi- can drug cartels and Chinese transnational criminal organizations engaged in money-laundering operations throughout the United States. This was reinforced by testimony from Federal counter-nar- cotics officials in a Senate hearing 2 weeks ago that Chinese crimi- nal organizations have, ‘‘Emerged as the professional money launderers of choice for Mexican drug traffickers.’’ Recent reporting has also uncovered that Chinese-run marijuana farms are all across the United States and many of them exploit workers from China. Transnational criminal organizations and the CCP see our open border as an opportunity. This surge of Chinese nationals at our border without recent precedent presents inter- national security vulnerability ripe for exploitation. It makes no sense that the Biden administration refuses to take common-sense steps to secure our border in the face of such obvi- ous threats to our homeland. Instead, we get more of the same catch-and-release policies that have set the country on this dan- gerous course for the past 3 years and all that some can say is that the Congress should codify and institutionalize these very prac- tices. I want to thank our witnesses for being here today, and I look forward to their testimony. [The statement of Chairman Bishop follows:] STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN DAN BISHOP MAY 16, 2024 Today’s subcommittee hearing will examine the unprecedented number of Chinese foreign nationals crossing the border and whether this represents a risk to home- land security. Border Patrol records show that from 2007 to 2021 encounters of Chinese nation- als illegally entering the United States at the Southwest Border were relatively rare, averaging a little over 1,000 per year. That changed dramatically under the Biden administration, rising from 1,970 in fiscal year 2022 to 24,048 in fiscal year 2023, an 1,100 percent increase.4 In the last 7 months, from October to April, Border Patrol has already encoun- tered 27,496 Chinese nationals—shattering last year’s total. At this pace, the full fiscal year will see encounters of illegal Chinese immigrants 2,300 percent higher the rate just 2 years ago. This is a national security concern, and it’s not a new one. One year ago, the cur- rent Border Patrol Chief and then-Del Rio Sector Chief, Jason Owens, testified in a transcribed interview with the committee that, ‘‘even without the increase, people coming from the PRC would be of concern to me. That’s always going to be a group we look at more closely and work with our partners, with FBI, to make sure they don’t pose a threat.’’ I agree that there is a serious national security concern, and we should be looking closely at individuals coming from Communist China, the United States’ greatest adversary on the world stage. Unfortunately, under the Biden administration, Border Patrol agents have been instructed that when processing Chinese nationals, they should conduct short, basic interviews, that include only generic background questions, instead of in-depth interviews. In other words, their serious vetting. These questions simply ask about military service, education, birthplace in China, employment, and political affiliation with the CCP. While agents only proceed to an in-depth interview if one of the answers in the basic interview is flagged, it begs the question—how likely is it that someone show- ing up at the border is going to admit that they are here to do the bidding of the Chinese Communist Party or perhaps the PLA? Instead, that person will likely provide the answers their smugglers told them to give Border Patrol. Just give the right answers and come right on into our home- land. These limited interviews, combined with a lack of reliable information from China to verify biographical claims and limited translation services, severely constrain CBP’s ability to conduct rigorous vetting for criminal and national security concerns. One Border Patrol sector chief told the committee that it could be difficult to de- termine the motives of those detained who come from distant countries, like China, stating that, ‘‘we try our best to figure out why they’re coming, but of course, that information can be hidden. Their agendas, their ideologies, the reason for them com- ing could be missed.’’1 This is especially true for ‘‘gotaways’’—those who avoid apprehension, and who re- portedly pay as much as $60,000 to be smuggled illegally into the United States. The Government has no idea who the ‘‘gotaways’’ are or why they are crossing the border and deliberately trying to avoid Border Patrol. But something tells me the motive wasn’t likely to be aboveboard. Some Chinese nationals may be motivated to seek asylum on legitimate claims of persecution, such as Uyghurs from Xinjiang. But it is more likely that they come for economic reasons or other motives that do not meet the statutory requirements for asylum. And considering the Biden administration’s failure to hold China to account, these Chinese nationals also know that it is very unlikely that they will ever be returned to China, under this administration’s policies, even if ordered removed by an Immi- gration Judge. Some Chinese nationals may have more nefarious motives for coming to the United States. For example, Federal indictments in North Carolina from last month show partnerships between Mexican drug cartels and Chinese transnational crimi- nal organizations engaged in money-laundering operations throughout the United States. This was reinforced by testimony from Federal counter-narcotics officials in a Sen- ate hearing 2 weeks ago that Chinese criminal organizations have ‘‘emerged as the professional money launderers of choice for Mexican drug traffickers.’’ Recent reporting has also uncovered that Chinese-run marijuana farms are all across the United States, and many of them exploit workers from China. Transnational criminal organizations and the CCP see our open border as an op- portunity. This surge of Chinese nationals at our border without recent precedent presents a major national security vulnerability, ripe for exploitation. It makes no sense that the Biden administration refuses to take common-sense steps to secure our border in the face of such obvious threats to our homeland. Instead, we get more of the same catch-and-release policies that have set the country on this dangerous course for the past 3 years, and all that some can say is that the Congress should codify and institutionalize these very practices. 1 El Paso Sector Chief Anthony Good.5 I want to thank our witnesses for being here today, and I look forward to their testimony. Chairman BISHOP. Well, give me a second. I am getting to the part where I recognize you. I now recognize the Ranking Member, the gentleman from Maryland, Mr. Ivey, for his opening statement. Mr. IVEY. I was going to say that might be sufficient, just the—— Chairman BISHOP. I figured there was something else in there I probably should read, but you are exactly right. That was easy enough. Mr. IVEY. Well, I thank the Chairman for that. It is May. This is the month when we typically celebrate and honor the culture, heritage, achievements, and contributions of Asian Americans, Na- tive Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders, and I want to make sure that we honor those contributions and steer away from any kind of concerns or rhetoric with respect to—I want to make sure that our friends from the Asian communities are not mischaracterized or misunderstood by who they are and what they are doing. You know, there is a lot of rhetoric, I have got to say, that I hear. Recently, I have got, for example, despite the invasion rhetoric some Republican colleagues are spreading, it is only a tiny fraction of border crossers who are coming from China. In the first 4 months of this fiscal year less than 2 percent, 2.5 percent of border crossers were Chinese nationals. In fact, Chinese nationals are neither one of the fastest-growing nationalities apprehended along the Southwest Border nor one of the top 10 nationalities apprehended at the U.S. border. You know, I have seen and heard rhetoric that Chinese immi- grants coming across the border to ‘‘build an army.’’ One statement was made without any evidence that ‘‘it’s virtually certain’’ that some Chinese border crossers are spies. One Republican’s com- ments calling Chinese immigration an invasion, and I think that is the kind of rhetoric we want to steer away from. I do think it is important to say this, that we have got people crossing the border for a variety of reasons. I think part of it is eco- nomic, as the Chairman referenced. Part of it, and we have had some hearings with respect to the Uyghurs, it is a bit ironic that this subcommittee has held hearings about that and it goes to the repression of the Uyghurs and in some instances forced labor or slave labor. I want to make sure that we keep those sorts of pressures in mind in addition to the national and international migration pat- terns that are in reference here. I think we should keep in mind some of the comments that the Border Patrol chiefs have made. We had recent conversations with them. Here is what they did say about Chinese border crossers. One statement, ‘‘That specific demographic doesn’t cause me con- cern.’’ Another one, ‘‘We treat everybody the same. It doesn’t matter where they come from. It doesn’t matter what your nationality is, what your religious beliefs are. We’re going to treat everybody ex- actly the same. They run through the same screening, the same processing, the same background checks. Everything we have ac- cess to we are going to check on each and every person.’’6 There is another exchange, ‘‘Question: Do you know what reasons Chinese nationals are giving in their interviews for coming? An- swer: The typical reason is the same as for most migrants, for work or a better life.’’ So, you know, let’s keep all that stuff in mind as we sort-of work our way through this. I think a big piece of where we ought to be going is legislation. I was not a full fan of the Senate bill that was proposed a few months ago by Senator Lankford and others, but I thought it was a big step in the right direction. I was very disappointed that former President Trump essentially killed the bill, an opportunity to work on the legislation, by state- ments he made publicly and the adoption of those positions by the Speaker here and most of our House Republicans in general. I would say this. I mean, I know that I have had colleagues on this committee and on the Judiciary Committee raise concerns about the legislation that was proposed from the Senate, but I would just remind my colleagues that we have this amendment process here. If we bring up legislation in the committee, they can offer amendments to address it. Guess what? They are the Majority on not only both committees but on the overall floor as well, so they could adapt amendments if they wanted to. But instead of moving forward and working on this type of legislation, whether they think it needs to be amended or not, they are not bringing it up and we are focusing on other things instead. I was heartened to see that Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy stated, I think yesterday, well, it may have been earlier today, that he wants to renew the push for the bipartisan legislation that was proposed in the Senate. I think that is a great idea because it ad- dresses some of the concerns that are underlying this particular hearing, the need for more border agents, the need to make the process work faster, the need to get more judges who can adju- dicate these cases more quickly because that will help to address some of the problems that we are facing, I think, at the border and with the migration patterns. I also think that the funding piece is important. I know there are a lot of times I have heard comments that the resources don’t mat- ter, at least from my Republican colleagues, but when we get testi- mony from Border Patrol agents, even in this committee they al- ways say, yes, we need more resources. We don’t have enough people to cover the border. We don’t have enough money to retain many of the people that we have. They leave to go do other things and get paid larger salaries for less rig- orous work. We don’t have as many judges as we need to handle all these cases, so I am hoping we can address those things as well. So I want to thank the panel for being here today. I look forward to your testimony and not necessarily that I am going to agree with everything or you are going to agree with everything I say or that you will even agree with each other. That is not necessarily the point. But I do appreciate the fact that, and I thank the Chairman for this, bringing in people who can shed light on what is going on down there. There is just a lot of partisanism around this and, you7 know, that goes with the territory. This is not only Washington, DC, but Capitol Hill. But I think we need to hit a point, and we did this with the sub- committee hearings we had with respect to the Uyghurs and I raised African, you know, countries that had forced labor going on there as well. We have shown we can do it, and I am hoping we can do that again here in this instance and ultimately find our way to legisla- tion that can address the overall problems, not just with respect to Chinese migrants, but all of the issues at the border as well. With that, I yield back. Chairman BISHOP. Thank you, Ranking Member Ivey. Other Members of the committee are reminded that opening statements may be submitted for the record. I am pleased that we have a distinguished panel of witnesses be- fore us today to examine this topic. [Witnesses sworn.] Chairman BISHOP.

STATEMENT OF SIMON R. HANKINSON, SENIOR RESEARCH FELLOW, BORDER SECURITY AND IMMIGRATION CENTER, THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION Mr. HANKINSON. Chairman Bishop, Ranking Member Ivey, Mem- bers of the committee, I served as a foreign service officer in 7 countries. I have adjudicated thousands of visa applications to fa- cilitate lawful visits and immigration while excluding aliens who were legally inadmissible. The visa process overseas stands in total contrast to what hap- pens at the U.S. border today. Over the past 2 years I have visited the border in Arizona, California, New York, and Texas. I saw na- tionals of many countries apprehended by the Border Patrol. In San Diego last March, I watched Border Patrol dropping off dozens of aliens, including Chinese, at a bus stop. Such mass re- lease of people who entered the country illegally happens every day, multiple times at multiple locations. At best this is a mockery8 of U.S. immigration law and sovereignty, and at worst it is a huge national security and community safety risk. In addition to many Chinese with connections to the Communist Party, People’s Liberation Army, and other state entities, it is sta- tistically probable that DHS is releasing people with criminal records. According to U.S. law, DHS should detain aliens caught entering illegally, but the Biden administration has replaced border control with mass processing and release and they have abused im- migration parole at an unprecedented scale. In January 2021, the Border Patrol encountered 17 Chinese be- tween ports of entry. This year in January it was 3,700. I won’t re- peat the rest of the numbers but we are close to 50,000 already this fiscal year. Nearly all of them are being released into an asylum process that will take years to conclude and then those eventually ordered re- moved are unlikely to be deported because the Chinese government does not cooperate in accepting their nationals. In fact, in fiscal year 2023, ICE removed a total of 288 Chinese, leaving up to 100,000 still in the United States despite final orders of removal. Most Chinese entering the United States illegally are seeking employment. They use asylum claims to enter, to remain, and to work. Illegal immigration ebbs and flows corresponding to a risk- and-reward calculation, and the reason that Chinese are coming in great numbers today is simply because they can. The world-wide awareness of our open borders spread by social media shows them how. The Chinese have massive economic investments in Latin Amer- ica. They have close ties with governments, including Brazil, Cuba, and Venezuela. They don’t need visas to fly to Ecuador after which they can continue by land to the United States. Tomorrow, May 17, Air China begins direct flights from Beijing to Havana. Meanwhile, Chinese investments in the United States, both legal and illegitimate, are growing, providing many new op- portunities for work. More people are on the way. Now, overseas and in-person interview by a consular officer is the first line of vetting for visa applicants. This is buttressed by staff who know local languages, customs, and news, and in larger embassies we have other Federal agencies who can assist with in- vestigations. The second line of vetting is through automatic checks of U.S. Government databases. Applicants are frequently refused visas due to adverse information that would not have been discovered had they simply showed up at the border with no identity documents. Meanwhile at the border today, most so-called national security decisions of who gets into our country are no longer made by Amer- ican officers. Under President Biden’s policies, what was once a privilege has become a right. Despite what the administration wishes the public to believe, there is no real vetting of those re- leased at the border, nor of those allowed in under parole pro- grams, much less the got-aways who enter entirely without inspec- tion. The official visa front door competes with a wide-open back door at the border where there are no routine criminal background9 checks for home country. Unless a foreign national has a record held by U.S. agencies, DHS is flying blind. Concerning China specifically, CBP agents have reportedly re- duced the number of standard questions asked of inadmissible Chi- nese from 40 to 5, but however many the questions the process re- lies on an alien telling the truth. Even if CBP requests additional information on a particular individual, China routinely ignores U.S. requests for verification of nationality and they reportedly hide domestic records of criminal and corruption cases. DHS releases most aliens with a notice to appear in immigration court far in the future and they are then free to go where they want with no easy way for ICE to find them. There are more than 6 million aliens on ICE’s nondetained docket and from only about 184,000 are tracked and only 2 percent of those with GPS mon- itors. To close this dangerous loophole the United States needs to re- implement agreements with Mexico and Central America so that inadmissible aliens are not released into the interior pending the decision in their asylum cases. Given the population, economy, and politics of China, we can never meet the demand for those seeking to enter illegally. At some point the United States will either have to remove those who are ineligible to enter or remain or else aban- don the rule of law. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. Hankinson follows:] PREPARED STATEMENT OF SIMON R. HANKINSON MAY 16, 2024 Chairman Bishop, Ranking Member Ivey, and Members of the committee, my name is Simon Hankinson. I am a senior research fellow at The Heritage Founda- tion. The views I express in this testimony are my own and should not be construed as representing any official position of The Heritage Foundation. INTRODUCTION I spent 23 years as a Foreign Service officer with the Department of State, serv- ing at U.S. diplomatic missions in 7 countries. For much of that time, I adjudicated visa cases as a consular officer or supervised others who did. I and my staff con- ducted interviews, investigated fraud, worked with host country law enforcement, and cooperated with other U.S. agencies to enforce immigration laws of the United States. The mission was clear: Facilitate lawful visits, commerce, and immigration while excluding those aliens who were inadmissible under our laws for a variety of reasons. Since January 2021, the Department of State’s consular mission overseas that I worked 2 decades to support stands in almost total contrast to what we are seeing at the U.S. land borders, where the Biden administration oversees a de facto open border. In May 2022, I retired from the State Department. Over the past 2 years, I have visited the U.S. border at Malone, New York; McAllen, Eagle Pass, and Del Rio, Texas; Yuma, Arizona; and San Diego, California. In Arizona, Texas, and especially California, I witnessed people from China among the nationals of many countries apprehended by the Border Patrol. In San Diego, I saw several groups of Chinese men released by Border Patrol. Mass release like this of people who entered the country illegally happens nearly every day, multiple times, at multiple locations. This continuous mass release of inadmissible aliens is, at best, a mockery of U.S. immigration law, labor law, and national sovereignty. At worst, it is a national secu- rity and community safety risk of unknown proportions. In addition to Chinese na- tionals with connections to the Communist Party, People’s Liberation Army, and other elements of the Chinese state, it is statistically likely that DHS is releasing aliens who have serious criminal records in China that are unknown to U.S. au- thorities. Extrapolating from recidivism rates among U.S. violent offenders after re- lease from prison, we can be certain that the mass release of aliens who would10 never pass a background check will result in preventable crimes committed in the United States in future.1 Furthermore, while those inadmissible aliens arrested before being released at least have to provide biometric data that will then be permanently assigned to them, even should they attempt to change their identity in future, the ‘‘gotaways’’ who enter the United States without inspection or contact with any official do not even get that weak level of vetting. The Biden administration’s continued prioritization of continued flow of illegal migration over securing the border, and DHS’s resulting diversion of staff to processing aliens into the country, makes entry without inspection easier than ever. So far this year, more than 24,000 Chinese nationals have entered the United States illegally over the southwest land border.2 It appears nearly all are being re- leased, into an asylum process that will take many years to conclude. At the end of that process, even those Chinese nationals denied asylum and ordered removed are extremely unlikely to be deported. The Chinese government has long been deemed ‘‘recalcitrant,’’ which is the term ICE uses for countries that are uncoopera- tive with the U.S. Government in accepting their nationals who are ordered re- moved by U.S. immigration courts. ‘‘The Chinese government . . . will accept repa- triation of Chinese citizens who have been verified to be from mainland China,’’ ac- cording to their Embassy in Washington.3 However, they do not interview and docu- ment their nationals timely and accurately when requested by ICE, as cooperative countries do (and as the United States does for its own nationals when asked). Ac- cording to a 2021 Department of Homeland Security (DHS) report, ‘‘the PRC has ignored more than 1,300 ICE requests for travel documents since October 2017. Consequently, ICE has been forced to release more than 1,000 PRC nationals from custody, many with convictions for violent or other serious crimes.’’4 A ‘‘DHS Strategic Action Plan to Counter the Threat Posed by the People’s Repub- lic of China,’’ written at the tail end of the Trump administration, claimed that DHS ‘‘has and will continue to augment immigration vetting and monitoring, including for student and tourist visas, and will return PRC visa-overstays who continue to undermine visa integrity.5 This has not been the case under the Biden administra- tion. In fiscal year 2023, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deported a total of 288 Chinese back to China.6 As noted in a 2019 DHS Inspector General re- port, some foreign embassies ‘‘do not conduct timely interviews with detainees or no- tify ICE when additional information is required to facilitate travel, delaying remov- als.’’7 ICE maintains a list of ‘‘Recalcitrant’’ countries that do not facilitate the repa- triation of their nationals, as well as a list of countries ‘‘At Risk of Non-Compli- ance.’’8 As of 2020, China was listed as Recalcitrant. In 2016, there were over 20,000 convicted criminal alien Chinese nationals that the United States was not able to remove.9 In 2021, DHS reported that ‘‘approximately 40,800 PRC nationals in the United States are subject to final orders of removal.’’10 However, in November 2023, the New York Times quoted an anonymous Biden administration official as saying 1 Simon Hankinson, Lora Ries, and Matthew Kuckelman, Backgrounder: ‘‘Biden’s Open Bor- ders and Non-Enforcement Mean Americans Play ‘Recidivist Roulette’ with Criminal Aliens,’’ The Heritage Foundation, May 7, 2024, https://www.heritage.org/immigration/report/bidens- open-borders-and-non-enforcement-mean-americans-play-recidivist-roulette. 2 U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, ‘‘Nationwide Encounters,’’ https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/nationwide-encounters, (accessed May 10, 2024). 3 David Noriega and Julia Ainsley, ‘‘U.S. and China in high-level talks to deport more Chinese nationals, Mayorkas says,’’ NBC News, April 5, 2024, https://www.nbcnews.com/investigations/ us-china-high-level-talks-deport-chinese-nationals-mayorkas-says-rcna146590. 4 Department of Homeland Security, ‘‘DHS Strategic Action Plan to Counter the Threat Posed by the People’s Republic of China,’’ January 12, 2021, https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/ publications/21l0112lplcyldhs-china-sap.pdf. 5 DHS Strategic Action Plan to Counter the Threat Posed by the People’s Republic of China. 6 Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Annual Report, Fiscal Year 2023, Published Decem- ber 29, 2023, https://www.ice.gov/doclib/eoy/iceAnnualReportFY2023.pdf. 7 Department of Homeland Security, Office of the Inspector General, ‘‘ICE Faces Barriers in Timely Repatriation of Detained Aliens,’’ OIG–19–28, March 11, 2019, https://www.oig.dhs.gov/ sites/default/files/assets/2019-03/OIG-19-28-Mar19.pdf. 8 Congressional Research Service, ‘‘Immigration: ‘Recalcitrant’ Countries and the Use of Visa Sanctions to Encourage Cooperation with Alien Removals,’’ July 10, 2020, https:// crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11025. 9 Author’s personal knowledge at the time. 10 DHS Strategic Action Plan to Counter the Threat Posed by the People’s Republic of China.11 that ‘‘Of the 1.3 million people in the United States with final orders to be deported, about 100,000 are Chinese.’’11 Therefore, by releasing Chinese at the border, the Biden administration is grant- ing them de facto immigrant status with no verification of their identity and back- ground. To restore order to the border and close this dangerous loophole, the United States needs to re-implement the Migrant Protection Protocols and Asylum Coopera- tive Agreements with Mexico and Northern Triangle countries so that inadmissible aliens, including Chinese asylum applicants, are not released into the interior pend- ing the decision in their cases. The United States should also apply maximum pres- sure to stop Latin American countries from facilitating Chinese to transit their countries on the way to the U.S. border. For example, Ecuador allows visa-free trav- el for Chinese nationals, Panama allows facilities to exist that cater exclusively to Chinese migrants, and Mexico does little to impede their progress through its terri- tory to the U.S. border. RECORD NUMBER OF CHINESE NATIONALS ILLEGALLY ENTERING THE U.S. BY LAND According to U.S. law, DHS is supposed to detain all inadmissible aliens who enter the country illegally between ports of entry. Illegal immigrants detained pend- ing removal proceedings have a high chance of being deported, while those released are likely to remain indefinitely, according the multiple DHS reports.12 At various times in the past, DHS has responded to surges in the number of illegal aliens en- countered at the border by releasing them on their own recognizance, having placed them in removal proceedings under U.S. immigration law.13 Since January 2021, this tactic has become the strategic norm and has reached epic proportions. Presi- dent Biden has added to the mass release policy by using the limited parole power in the Immigration and Nationality Act at an unprecedented scale and not for in- tended purposes.14 The last month of the Trump administration, January 2021, saw just 17 Chinese encountered at the Southwest Border between ports of entry (POEs). In January 2024, 3 years into the Biden administration, Border Patrol encountered 3,700 Chi- nese—200 hundred times as many. In fiscal year 2021, DHS had 23,471 total encounters with Chinese, and only 342 of them between POEs. In fiscal year 2022, DHS had 27,756 total encounters with Chinese, 1,987 of which were between POEs. In fiscal year 2023, DHS had 52,700 total encounters with Chinese, 24,125 of which were between POEs. In fiscal year 2024 as of March 31, the Department of Homeland Security encoun- tered 41,970 total inadmissible Chinese nationals at our borders. Twenty-four thou- sand, two hundred ninety-six of these were encounters by the Border Patrol between Ports of Entry (POEs), and 3,004 were encounters at POEs by Customs and Border Protection.15 On just 1 day in April 2024 (April 24) the Border Patrol encountered 206 Chinese nationals crossing into just the San Diego sector of the Southwest Border.16 San Diego sector has seen explosive growth in Chinese illegally arriving by foot. In fiscal year 2021, the Border Patrol had only 75 encounters with Chinese nationals all year in San Diego sector. That rose to 942 in fiscal year 2022, 10,520 in fiscal year 2023, and they are up to 23,890 in fiscal year 2024 so far.17 DHS has even granted ap- 11 Eileen Sullivan, ‘‘Growing Numbers of Chinese Migrants Are Crossing the Southern Bor- der,’’ New York Times, November 24, 2023, https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/24/us/politics/ china-migrants-us-border.html. 12 Nadwa Mossaad, Sean Leong, Ryan Baugh, and Marc Rosenblum, ‘‘Fiscal Year 2021 En- forcement Lifecycle Report,’’ U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Office of Immigration Sta- tistics, November 2022, p. 13, https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2022-12/2022l- 1114lplcylenforcementllifecyclelreportlfy2021.pdf (accessed October 16, 2023). 13 Title 8 U.S. Code, Aliens and Nationality, https://uscode.house.gov/browse/ &edition=prelim (accessed October 16, 2023). 14 Texas et al v.

Between January 2023 and September 30, 2023, Chinese nationals made 36 appointments on CBP One, of which 32 were granted parole.18 In March 2024, I visited the California border in San Diego, Jacumba Hot Springs, Otay Mesa, and Imperial Beach. I spent a morning watching 2 unmarked buses chartered by the Border Patrol dropping off aliens at San Diego’s Iris Avenue bus and tram stop. Single adult illegal immigrants in San Diego are released at sev- eral spots after minimal screening and assisted by NGO’s, family, and friends to move further into the United States. At Iris Avenue, I saw a row of Toyota Priuses driven by Chinese men looking for compatriots to solicit. The licensed cabdrivers I spoke to—who were legal immigrants from El Salvador, Somalia, and Ecuador—told me the Chinese drivers were operating illegal taxis.19 There were Chinese nationals, of apparently recent arrival, selling cigarettes, internet connections, and other serv- ices to their compatriots arriving off Border Patrol buses. The Border Patrol’s San Diego sector is attractive to Chinese illegal crossers for several reasons. One is that the U.S. city of 1.4 million people directly extends to the border, with the Mexican city of Tijuana literally built up to the border wall (where it exists) in many places. There is no desert like in Arizona, or river as in Texas, to present even a small natural obstacle. In addition, San Diego’s public tran- sit, the county’s network of non-governmental organizations, and the sanctuary poli- cies of California all facilitate easy entry and dispersal.20 Given the many gaps in the border wall, and daily breaches of the wall by alien smugglers in Mexico, there is no real impediment to the mass movement of people into the United States in this sector. Furthermore, in the words of former Border Patrol chief Rodney Scott, ‘‘there’s no real response from the Federal Government of the United States to slow it down. There hasn’t been since 2021.’’21 WHY CHINESE COME ILLEGALLY TO THE U.S. BORDER Push Factors: Economic and Political Drivers A recent Wilson Center article by Joshua Peng attributes the reasons Chinese leave China, often with the intent of remaining in another country via an asylum claim, to ‘‘fears of President Xi Jinping’s authoritarian rule and the experience of draconian zero-COVID policies’’ and ‘‘skepticism of the Chinese economy and fears of eventually being cast into poverty.’’22 A change to the Chinese constitution in 2018 allowed Xi Jinping a third Presidential term, removed time limits on his stay- ing in power, and strengthened his control as China’s leader.23 After 2020, China’s zero-COVID policy forced testing, vaccines, and lockdowns, enforced by surveillance state and sometimes violence.24 However, whatever the individual motivations for leaving, it should be noted that absent political persecution by the government of the applicant himself, none of the above reasons would qualify an applicant for asy- lum in the United States. Most reports agree that the majority of Chinese entering the United States ille- gally by land are economic migrants seeking employment.25 Like millions of other 18 U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Homeland Security, News Release, October 23, 2023, https://homeland.house.gov/2023/10/23/new-documents-obtained-by-homeland-ma- jority-detail-shocking-abuse-of-cbp-one-app/. 19 Simon Hankinson, ‘‘My Look Inside Biden’s Illegal Immigrant Catch-and-Release Cra- ziness,’’ The Daily Signal, April 08, 2024, https://www.dailysignal.com/2024/04/08/my-look-in- side-bidens-illegal-immigrant-catch-release-craziness-borderline/ (accessed May 10, 2024). 20 Virginia Allen, ‘‘6 Reasons Chinese Nationals Are Illegally Crossing California’s Southern Border,’’ The Daily Signal, April 28, 2024, https://www.dailysignal.com/2024/04/28/6-reasons- chinese-nationals-illegally-crossing-californias-southern-border/, (accessed May 10, 2024). 21 Allen, Ibid. 22 Joshua Peng, ‘‘Through the Darién Gap: A New Path for Chinese Asylum Seekers to the United States,’’ The Wilson Center, March 20, 2024, https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/ through-darien-gap-new-path-chinese-asylum-seekers-united-states#:?:text=Over%2015%2C500- %20Chinese%20migrants%20were,40%20times%20that%20of%202021. 23 Chris Buckley and Steven Lee Myers, ‘‘China’s Legislature Blesses Xi’s Indefinite Rule.

The Biden policy is to ‘‘significantly expand lawful pathways for protection, and facilitate the safe, or- derly, and humane processing of migrants.’’28 The result has been predictable: The easier it appears to be to enter the United States and be allowed to remain and work, the more people come. DHS has reported over 150,000 people at the border every month attempting to enter the United States illegally since January 2021.29 The Biden administration’s ‘‘root causes’’ approach has not reduced illegal immi- gration flows as allegedly intended. Neither has its ‘‘Comprehensive Plan to Manage the Border After Title 42.’’30 The intention of the Rule was to expedite the removal of those who were less likely to qualify for asylum and who had not taken advan- tage of the administration’s new parole programs using the CBP One application. However, as was widely predicted from the beginning, the Rule’s wide exceptions, including for families and certain nationalities, have made it nearly useless. Even with the new Rule’s demonstrable failure to reduce the flow of inadmissible aliens crossing the border, the administration’s default position remained to let in as many aliens as could be processed and nominally put them into the backlogged asylum system. In most cases, illegal border crossers are released without any way to track them or ensure that they attended scheduled court appearances.31 In addition to this ‘‘catch and release’’ standard, the administration has redirected tens of thousands of illegal aliens whom the Border Patrol would have ‘‘encoun- tered’’—that is, administratively arrested—crossing between ports of entry by in- venting and expanding programs to allow inadmissible aliens to enter the United States on immigration parole.32 They are paroled on the premise that they are refu- gees fleeing persecution who will apply for asylum rather than economic migrants. The administration has provided mass, class-wide parole programs for nationals of Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela and additional ‘‘family reunifi- cation’’ parole for beneficiaries of immediate relative immigrant visa petitions from Colombia, Cuba, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, or Honduras and their immediate family members.33 Over 50,000 more otherwise-inadmissible aliens are now being welcomed every month into the country at air and land entry points by inspectors with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Office of Field Operations.

Rising Chinese Influence in Latin America Rising Chinese wealth, expanding networks of professional smugglers, and complicit Latin American governments have facilitated Chinese travel to the United States land border. China has been investing in development, commercial, transpor- tation, military, and space projects throughout Latin America. Since 2005, China loaned more than $140 billion to Latin American countries including Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, and Venezuela. Eleven countries in Latin America—Argentina, Bo- livia, Chile, Costa Rica, Cuba, Ecuador, El Salvador, Panama, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela—have signed onto China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a world-wide transportation network financed and often built by China.35 The Chinese govern- ment has close ties with socialist and leftist governments across Latin America— in particular, economic giant Brazil, close U.S. neighbor Cuba, and oil-rich Ven- ezuela. Easier Travel to Latin America and the United States Under the Biden administration, Chinese nationals, like people from 180 other countries, come in increasing numbers simply because they can. World-wide aware- ness of our open border, spread by family, friends, and alien-smuggling criminals using social media, is the real ‘‘root cause’’ of the mass rush to the border since Jan- uary 2021, according to journalists who have spoken with prospective illegal immi- grants to the United States from many countries along the Panama-Mexico route.36 Chinese do not need a visa to fly to Ecuador, which has become a major entry point for them into Latin America. On May 17, Air China will begin direct flights from Beijing to Havana, with a stopover in Madrid, to increase tourism according to the official announcement.37 From Ecuador, many Chinese migrants headed for the United States cross through Colombia, the Darién Gap, and through Central America to Mexico and the U.S. border. According to Peng, ‘‘over 15,500 Chinese mi- grants were counted in Panama after traversing . . . the Darién Gap’’ in the first 9 months of 2023, which is 40 times the number that took this route in 2021.38 U.S. visitors to the Darién Gap report camps and infrastructure exclusively catering to Chinese illegal migrants. Author Brett Weinstein described ‘‘a kind of hostility’’ from Chinese migrants when he attempted to ask them about their journey, saying they ‘‘seemed interested in deliberately misleading us as to their origin and purpose.’’39 Voice of America interviews of Chinese who had crossed the Gap indicated economic motives as paramount in their decision to leave China and trek to the U.S. border.40 There are reports that others pay extra to bypass the Darién Gap by taking sea transport from Ecuador further north.41 According to Peng, ‘‘Chinese migrants typically spend between $5,000 and $7,000 for self-guided trips, and up to $35,000 for the aid of smugglers, 3 times what Latin 34 Press release, ‘‘Border Encounters Remain Low as Biden-Harris Administration’s Com- prehensive Plan to Manage the Border After Title 42 in Effect,’’ U.S. Department of Homeland Security, June 6, 2023, https://www.dhs.gov/news/2023/06/06/border-encounters-remain-low- biden-harris-administrations-comprehensive-plan-manage#:?:text=Until%20and%20unless%20- Congress%20comes,in%20migration%20at%20our%20border (accessed October 16, 2023). 35 John Polga-Hecimovich, ‘‘China’s evolving economic footprint in Latin America,’’ Geopolitical Intelligence Services AG, November 22, 2022, https://www.gisreportsonline.com/r/chinas-eco- nomic-power-grows-in-latin-america/. 36 Todd Bensman, Overrun: How Joe Biden Unleashed the Greatest Border Crisis in U.S. His- tory (Nashville: Bombardier Books, 2023). 37 ‘‘Air China will start direct Beijing-Havana flights on May 17,’’ Prensa Latina, April 12, 2024, https://www.plenglish.com/news/2024/04/12/air-china-will-start-direct-beijing-havana- flights-on-may-17/. 38 Peng.

Meanwhile, Chinese social media informs them of the logistics, including how to give themselves up to U.S. Border Patrol once they have entered the United States.43 According to the Asia Society, the social media app Douyin (the Chinese version of TikTok, also owned by parent company ByteDance) recently banned the word ‘‘zouxian’’ (‘‘walk the line’’) from search results. That term, and others, is a eu- phemism for illegal migration out of China including into the United States. Accord- ing to analyst Lynette Ong of the Center for Chinese Analysis, ‘‘Douyin’s censorship was likely the result of pressure from Chinese authorities embarrassed by the mag- nitude of the exodus’’ of Chinese who use Douyin to guide them on their journey to Latin America and north to the U.S. border.44 Chinese Immigration After 1965 It was difficult for Chinese to enter the United States until the Immigration Act of 1965, which began the modern era of mass immigration into the United States. The majority of immigrants to the United States now come now from Latin America, Asia, and Africa rather than Europe as in the previous 3 centuries. In 1993, some Chinese were prepared to pay up to $30,000 each for passage by sea and even to be smuggled in shipping containers.45 The flows from China have ebbed and flowed over the years, corresponding to the risk-reward calculation of spending thousands of dollars on alien smuggling services compared to the chance of being allowed into the United States to work and live indefinitely. Chinese nationals have been able to find black market, illegal employment for generations in the U.S. informal service industries, particularly in the bigger cities’ ‘‘Chinatowns.’’ Today, there are also opportunities in rural areas, where Chinese in- vestors and criminal syndicates are systematically buying land. In 2021, Chinese owners held 384,000 acres in the United States, according to the Department of Ag- riculture, amounting to 1% of land held by foreigners.46 According to a report by Brian Burack of the Heritage Foundation, ‘‘national security threats stemming from Chinese purchases of U.S. land and real estate are growing.’’47 Burack writes that ‘‘the totality of Chinese-owned real estate is unknown, and under current law, is un- knowable,’’ adding that Chinese-owned agricultural land has ‘‘increased rapidly in recent years’’ and that Chinese ‘‘were the top foreign buyers of U.S. commercial real estate’’ in 2020.48 Large holdings of land are owned by shell companies and cutouts that can obscure the real holder’s Chinese origin.49 Chinese individuals and entities have also purchased or attempted to buy land close to U.S. military installations in several States.50 Indentured labor to pay off alien smuggling fees has been common in Chinese, and other, illegal migration for decades. There have been recent reports of mari- juana farms in rural America run by Chinese criminal groups, who appear to em- ploy Chinese nationals with questionable immigration status, including one from Maine in March 2024.51 While the stories of abuse or exploitation told by Chinese laborers in these Chinese-owned farms, factories, and other businesses may be true, they may also be convenient ways for the worker-‘‘victims’’ to further their asylum claims or apply for visas reserved for victims of crime. 42 Peng, Ibid. 43 Author’s conversation with Michael Cunningham, Research Fellow, The Heritage Founda- tion. 44 Lynette Ong, ‘‘Douyin Censors Migrant Searches,’’ Asia Society Policy Institute, China 5 Newsletter, May 10, 2024. 45 Morning Edition, ‘‘Finding An Anchor For A Life Set Adrift By A Shipwreck,’’ National Pub- lic Radio, June 7, 2024, https://www.npr.org/2013/06/07/189222117/finding-an-anchor-for-a- life-set-adrift-by-a-shipwreck. 46 Allen, Ibid. 47 Brian Burack, ‘‘China’s Land Grab: The Sale of U.S. Real Estate to Foreign Adversaries Threatens National Security,’’ The Heritage Foundation, May 9, 2024, https:// www.heritage.org/asia/report/chinas-land-grab-the-sale-us-real-estate-foreign-adversaries-threat- ens-national. 48 Burack, Ibid. 49 Burack, Ibid. 50 Mike Heuer, ‘‘Chinese ownership of U.S. farmland, locations raise concerns,’’ UPI, February 8, 2024, https://www.upi.com/ToplNews/US/2024/02/08/foreign-investment-farmland- china/6631706895056/#:?:text=For%20example%2C%20a%20Chinese%20company,Guard%20- training%20facility%20in%20Grayling (accessed May 10, 2024). 51 Donovan Lynch, ‘‘As police crack down on illegal marijuana grows, Chinese workers present grim reality behind closed doors,’’ NewsCenter Maine, March 19, 2924, https:// www.newscentermaine.com/article/news/crime/illegal-marijuana-grows-chinese-workers-maine- court-documents-investigation/97-ae363572-3d17-479a-bc90-5ea509eaecfc (accessed May 10, 2024).16 While China was poor, emigration to the United States was largely a one-way street. Today, China’s enormous economic growth provides more opportunities for the PRC to influence U.S. politics through its diaspora. To cite one example, the Na- tional Review recently reported on Chinese-American John Chan’s ‘‘constellation of nonprofit organizations and businesses’’ which, along with his connections with the Chinese government and New York State politicians, he reportedly uses to advocate for positions favored by the People’s Republic of China.52 WHO ARE THEY? IDENTIFYING AND VETTING CHINESE LEGAL AND ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ‘‘Vetting’’ in Consular Visa Operations Twenty-five years ago on the visa line in New Delhi, I would interview at least 150 visa applicants a day and enter my decision into a computerized non-immigrant visa (NIV) system. With reference to the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), my job was to decide whether each applicant qualified for a visa. After 9/11, the State Department used to tell adjudicating officers that ‘‘every visa decision is a national security decision.’’ If an applicant did not qualify under the law, we did not issue a visa. The most common reason for denial was under INA s.214(b), which in brief requires every alien to prove to the consular officer that he is going to the United States for the purpose stated, and that he has a home outside the United States to which he intended to return. There are also many reasons a person can be ineli- gible from getting a visa under the INA, mostly under s.212, including criminal offences, public health concerns, and previous immigration violations. This personal consular interview is the first line of ‘‘vetting’’ for foreign visa applicants. The second line of vetting is through automatic checks of U.S. databases con- taining holdings from across government agencies. Names, dates of birth, and other facts are run through the Consular Lookout and Support System (CLASS) main- tained by the State Department’s Bureau of Consular Affairs. This system pulls data from Federal agencies that in turn have data from State and local law enforce- ment, such that if a foreigner has a criminal or other adverse history in the United States, they are likely to be flagged for further review before a visa is issued. Visa applicants must also provide photographs and all 10 fingerprints (if available). These are confirmed by embassy or consular staff and the interviewing consular offi- cer and then run through facial recognition and fingerprint databases to see if there are any matches. Adverse results are addressed by the interviewing or adjudicating consular officer before they make a decision. It is quite common to find applicants with false names and dates of birth, even with legitimately-issued foreign passports, because their other identities can be com- pared to bio-data databases. Fingerprints don’t change, and facial recognition is al- ways improving. Although visa applicants do not have to supply criminal records clearances from their national police agency, which is a requirement for immigrant visas, they are required to attest on a signed form that they have no criminal record and no other ineligibility. Embassies and consulates have local and American staff trained in anti-fraud measures. Consular staff know local languages, accents, cus- toms, news, and other country-specific factors that can help prevent applicants from lying successfully in their visa applications. Larger embassies host various Federal agencies, including elements of DHS and other Federal law enforcement, who have local contacts with their counterparts through whom they can investigate cases of concern. Unfortunately, the Biden administration appears unwilling to support the State Department’s foreign efforts by investigating and prosecuting visa fraud in national security cases. Even before the Biden administration canceled the Justice Depart- ment’s China initiative in 2022, apparently on the grounds that it was racially bi- ased,53 it began dropping fraud charges 54 against alleged Chinese military per- sonnel accused of falsifying visa applications.55 It appears that the Justice Depart- 52 Jimmy Quinn, ‘‘New Player in Chinese Communist Influence Body Has Extensive NYC Po- litical Ties,’’ National Review, May 10, 2024, https://www.nationalreview.com/2024/05/new- player-in-chinese-communist-influence-body-has-extensive-nyc-political-ties/. 53 U.S. Department of Justice, Remarks by Assistant Attorney General Matthew Olsen on Countering Nation-State Threats, Wednesday, February 23, 2022, https://www.justice.gov/opa/ speech/assistant-attorney-general-matthew-olsen-delivers-remarks-countering-nation-state-threats. 54 Jane Lee, ‘‘U.S. dials back probe of Chinese scientists on visa fraud charges,’’ Reuters, July 23, 2021, https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-seeks-dismiss-charges-visa-fraud-cases-chinese- researchers-2021-07-23/. 55 U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Public Affairs, Press Release, ‘‘Researchers Charged with Visa Fraud After Lying About Their Work for China’s People’s Liberation Army,’’ Thurs- day, July 23, 2020, https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/researchers-charged-visa-fraud-after-lying- about-their-work-china-s-people-s-liberation-army.17 ment’s National Security Division has not prosecuted any new China-related visa fraud cases since February, 2021, even though multiple visa fraud cases begun by the Trump administration resulted in convictions.56 Still, although vetting of foreign visa applicants is by no means foolproof, it is multi-layered and frequently results in visa refusals based on adverse information that would not have been discovered had the person simply arrived illegally, with no identity documents, at the U.S. border. VETTING BY DHS AT THE BORDER After 2021, most ‘‘national security decisions’’ of who gets into our country are no longer made by American officers. Under President Biden’s border policies, what was a privilege has become a right. The United States has outsourced the decision on who gets in at the border to foreign nationals based on who simply shows up in person, or who applies to enter the United States and ask for parole using CBP One. We still have a visa system overseas, but this expensive official ‘‘front door’’ competes with a wide-open back door at the Southern Border, where DHS releases most of them into the interior after minimal processing. There are no fees, no forms, and no way to routinely verify a given name, age, and identity. Worst of all, there are no criminal background checks in the person’s home country or anywhere they pass through. DHS mostly takes an individual’s given information on trust. While the majority of those arriving illegally are economic migrants who will claim asylum to be allowed to remain and work, ‘‘There is a realistic probability that some Chi- nese nationals illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border have ties to Chinese intel- ligence, using U.S. border vulnerabilities for espionage,’’ according to private intel- ligence analyst Grey Dynamics.57 In January 2024, the Daily Caller reported that the Biden administration has ‘‘drastically simplified the vetting process for Chinese illegal immigrants’’ started in April 2023, based on a source at U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).58 Ac- cording to information obtained by the Daily Caller, CBP agents including Border Patrol were instructed to reduce the number of standard questions asked of inad- missible Chinese from 40 to 5. This approach is in line with the Biden administra- tion’s overall policy of processing in as many inadmissible aliens as possible, prioritizing maximum flow over vetting. A former Government official told the Daily Caller that Chinese arrested at the border are well-coached on how to answer these questions, so as to be released soonest. From my own experience with visa inter- views and investigating consular fraud in several countries, I know that alien smug- glers include training on how to answer interview questions from American officials in their package deals. Such training is designed to avoid further investigation into the inadmissible alien’s background, while maximizing chances for a successful, if fraudulent, asylum claim. Like the ‘‘Security and Background Information’’ questions on the DS–160 visa application,59 the questions asked by CBP interviewers of inadmissible aliens at the border are intended to find out whether they have a criminal record; any connec- tions to the military, government, or political parties; and other information useful to determine whether they pose a security threat before they are released. Answer- ing ‘‘yes’’ to any of the security questions would lead to further enquiry and deten- tion pending the results. As the email obtained by the Daily Caller reads, ‘‘If there is a Yes to any of the above [security questions] they are then referred and trans- ported to [redacted] for an in-depth interview by Tactical Terrorism Response Team.’’ But whether 40 questions or 5, the process essentially relies on an illegal alien at the border telling the truth for his criminal past, membership in a totalitarian party, or terrorist affiliations to be discoverable, absent U.S. records on that indi- vidual. CBP says their ‘‘multi-layered border security efforts include various screen- ing and vetting processes that work to detect and prevent individuals who pose na- 56 U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Public Affairs, Press Release, ‘‘Chinese Government Employee Convicted of Participating in Conspiracy to Defraud the United States and Fraudu- lently Obtain U.S. Visas,’’ Wednesday, March 23, 2022, https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/chi- nese-government-employee-convicted-participating-conspiracy-defraud-united-states-and. 57 Betselot Dejene, ‘‘Chinese Espionage Threat at the US-Mexico Border,’’ Grey Dynamics, May 11, 2024, https://greydynamics.com/chinese-espionage-threat-at-the-us-mexico-border/. 58 Philip Lenczycki, ‘‘Biden Admin Watered Down Vetting Process For Chinese Illegal Immi- grants, Email Shows,’’ The Daily Caller, January 2, 2024, https://dailycaller.com/2024/01/02/ biden-admin-cbp-chinese-illegal-migrants/?utmlmedium=push&utmlsource=dailylcaller- &utmlcampaign=push. 59 U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs, ‘‘Online Nonimmigrant Visa Applica- tion DS–160,’’ p.68, https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/PDF-other/DS-160-Example- l11-19-2020.pdf.18 tional security or public safety risks from entering the United States.’’60 In fact, they have very limited means of verifying identify documents, statements, and any other information proffered by Chinese inadmissible aliens at the border before re- leasing them. China is hardly helpful in this regard, unless they have their own rea- sons for wanting a particular individual detained or returned to China. China rou- tinely ignores U.S. requests for verification of nationality of even dangerous crimi- nals. According to the State Department’s Country Report on Human Rights Prac- tices for 2022, ‘‘corruption remained rampant’’ in China.61 The Department’s 2023 Report removed that phrase for some reason but did report that ‘‘in general very few details were made public regarding the process by which CCP and government officials were investigated for corruption.’’62 In addition, according to the human rights NGO Safeguard Defenders, China’s ‘‘criminal justice data continues to be culled from official reports and the main database,’’ their research indicating that more than ‘‘85,000 verdicts from criminal judgments spanning 2013 to 2020 [were] removed’’ in the last year.63 China’s reluctance to publish, much less share, informa- tion about corrupt officials and criminals makes it very unlikely that CBP’s vetting, however ‘‘multilayered,’’ does much good at discovering the true backgrounds of in- admissible aliens before they are released. Acting CBP Commissioner Troy Miller admitted the obvious in testimony before the House Appropriations Committee on May 4 that DHS releases people without confirming ID.64 When asked by Rep. Andy Harris (R–MD) ‘‘So, we’re not admitting people into the interior who don’t have identification?’’ Miller responded that ‘‘we could release somebody with a notice to appear (NTA).’’ A Notice to Appear is a let- ter given to an alien by the Border Patrol or other agents of the DHS informing the subject that under section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) ‘‘you are an alien present in the United States without being admitted or pa- roled, or who arrived at any time or place other than as designated by the Attorney General,’’ and ordering the subject to appear before an immigration judge 65 at a specified time and place.66 This hearing begins immigration proceedings to remove them from the United States for being here illegally. The initial hearing might be many months, or even years, in the future. In practice, then, most aliens caught illegally crossing the U.S. border and re- leased with a Notice to Appear are released for an indefinite time, to go where they want in the country, with no way for ICE to know their true location or easily find them if needed. In the mean time, only a small minority of released aliens are under any kind of monitoring under Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Alternatives to Detention (ATD) program.67 There are more than 6 million aliens on ICE’s Non- Detained Docket (NDD), meaning aliens in immigration proceedings such as depor- tation or asylum claims. As of April 20, 2024, ICE was monitoring only 184,318 of this population using ATD.68 As of April 2023, only 2% of the aliens monitored under ATD were tracked with GPS monitors worn by the alien, with more than 91% tracked using methods that required the alien to actively participate by using a smart phone facial recognition application or calling a dedicated phone number.69 When I visited San Diego in March 2024, I witnessed the release of dozens of aliens from at least 15 countries. From my observations, GPS tracking devices, in the form of anklets, were being worn by people from Eastern Europe and Central 60 Philip Lenczycki, Daily Caller. 61 U.S. Department of State, 2022 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, ‘‘China (In- cludes Hong Kong, Macau, and Tibet),’’ Section 4, https://www.state.gov/reports/2022-country- reports-on-human-rights-practices/china/. 62 U.S. Department of State, 2023 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, ‘‘China (In- cludes Hong Kong, Macau, and Tibet),’’ Section 4, https://www.state.gov/reports/2023-country- reports-on-human-rights-practices/china/. 63 Safeguard Defenders, ‘‘Prosecutions abandoned, conviction rate record high, and more on China’s judiciary 2022,’’ https://safeguarddefenders.com/en/blog/prosecutions-abandoned-con- viction-rate-record-high-and-more-china-s-judiciary-2022, (accessed May 13, 2024). 64 Heritage Foundation, Twitter, https://x.com/Heritage/status/1786828427573477815, May 4, 2024. 65 Immigration judges are administrative judges working for the Department of Justice’s Exec- utive Office for Immigration Review, see https://www.justice.gov/eoir. 66 Simon Hankinson, ‘‘My Look Inside Biden’s Illegal Immigrant Catch-and-Release Cra- ziness,’’ The Daily Signal, April 08, 2024, https://www.dailysignal.com/2024/04/08/my-look-in- side-bidens-illegal-immigrant-catch-release-craziness-borderline/ (accessed May 10, 2024). 67 Simon Hankinson, ‘‘ ‘Alternatives to Detention’ for Illegal Aliens: Effective with Mandatory Tracking for Entire Process,’’ Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 3767, May 12, 2023, https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/2023-05/BG3767l0.pdf. 68 TRAC Immigration, ‘‘Immigration Detention Quick Facts, https://trac.syr.edu/immigra- tion/quickfacts/, (accessed May 10, 2024). 69 Hankinson, ‘‘Alternatives to Detention’’.19 Asia (Chechnya, Russia, Kazakhstan) but not Africa, China, India, or Latin Amer- ica. I have also personally inspected several NTAs given to aliens released at the border in Arizona, California, and Texas. On these, the locations for the alien’s scheduled immigration hearing may be nowhere near the alien’s intended destina- tion in the United States. For example, one Indian released in San Diego in March 2024 told me he was going to live with his uncle in Indiana, but he had a court date in May 2024 in Van Nuys, California, which is 2,085 miles away. Without a drivers’ license or any identification documents, it is difficult to see how he and other aliens will be able to make the journey of hundreds of miles to attend all of the hearings in their removal proceedings. In March 2023, I visited a gap in the unfinished border wall near the Morelos Dam in Yuma. President Biden ordered all work on the wall to stop shortly after taking office. The Morelos Gap is one of many places in Arizona where the border is, for most intents and purposes, wide open. People of unknown identity from any- where in the world can simply walk up and come in. Under Secretary of Homeland Security Mayorkas, the illegal arrivals are met by the Border Patrol or whatever DHS elements are available and channeled into a system that is designed to get them into the interior of the United States as fast as possible. Diverting DHS staff, including Border Patrol, from regular duty to providing administrative and social services leaves the border less guarded than usual, allowing even more illegal drugs, people, and goods into the country. At 3 o’clock a.m., I witnessed more than 100 people walking or running through the Gap to join a long line to be ‘‘processed.’’ I spoke to or saw people from Cam- eroon, China, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Georgia, India, and Russia. When asked, the people in line told me they were here to look for work and oppor- tunity. They get in with no application, no fee, no criminal background check, and none of the other inconveniences of having to qualify for a visa as our law requires before asking to be admitted into the United States. CONCLUSION Despite what the Biden administration wishes the American public to believe, there is no serious ‘‘vetting’’ of populations released at the U.S. border under Title 8 removal proceedings, nor of those allowed in under parole programs, much less the ‘‘gotaways’’ who enter without inspection. Unless a foreign national released or paroled has an existing record from previous time spent in the United States or a foreign record held by U.S. agencies for some other reason, DHS has no routine way of checking anyone’s background for criminal records, terrorist affiliation, member- ship in a hostile foreign government agency, or other concern. DHS also has no way to confirm the name, date of birth, or any other information proffered by an appli- cant unless that person has been encountered by a U.S. law enforcement agency be- fore. With up to 10 million people released or allowed to illegally enter the United States since January 2021, there is a considerable potential risk of espionage, crime, or other hostile action from some individuals in this population. The solution to the problem of growing illegal immigration is the same from the Biden administration on the U.S. political Left as it is for the Libertarians at the other extreme—eliminate illegal immigration by re-defining it as legal through so- called ‘‘lawful pathways’’ like parole; expanding Temporary Protected Status, Pros- ecutorial Discretion, Deferred Enforcement, and other tricks to avoid carrying out the intent of U.S. immigration law; releasing illegal aliens into interminable, theo- retical ‘‘removal’’ proceedings under Title 8; and increasing the overall number of temporary and permanent visas for workers and students. But even were it politi- cally acceptable to do, no amount of U.S. expansion would ever meet the demand given the population, economy, and politics of China. Whatever the upper limits on overall numbers, the United States will at some point need to police its borders and remove those who are ineligible to enter or re- main here under the law. Most importantly, those who are deliberately paroled or released must be identified, and their backgrounds vetted, more seriously than at present. The nationals of all countries present risks of criminal pasts and thus pre- dictable rates of recidivism. But nationals of countries hostile to U.S. interests like China, Iran, Russia, and others, require extra scrutiny. Chairman BISHOP. Thank you. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Singleton for 5 minutes for his opening statement.20 STATEMENT OF CRAIG SINGLETON, SENIOR FELLOW, FOUNDATION FOR DEFENSE OF DEMOCRACIES Mr. SINGLETON. Chairman Bishop, Ranking Member Ivey, and distinguished Members of this committee, thanks for the oppor- tunity to testify about how the Chinese Communist Party stands to exploit America’s border crisis to further its strategic interests and undermine U.S. national security. All told, the dramatic in- crease in Chinese nationals seeking to illegally enter the United States has reached unprecedented levels. Today’s surge is not simply a matter of immigration though. It is a multifaceted menace that mires our border management sys- tems and magnifies major national security risks. The drivers of to- day’s surge are complex. Economic instability and political repres- sion within China have propelled many Chinese to seek better lives abroad, yet this migration is also facilitated by sophisticated Chi- nese smuggling networks, readily accessible through Chinese social media platforms like WeChat and Douyin, China’s version of TikTok. These and other platforms provide prospective migrants with de- tailed step-by-step guidance about how to enter our country ille- gally, as well as facilitate direct connections with human traf- fickers. Given that context, the security implications of today’s bor- der surge are profound and worthy of further inquiry. For starters, the influx provides cover for Chinese intelligence operatives or those acting on their behalf to potentially infiltrate our borders. These operatives benefit from newfound operational flexibility insomuch as instability at the border allows them to evade traditional screening procedures at other American ports of entry. Furthermore, their diversification of tradecraft, using everything from false documentation to exploiting vulnerabilities in our border screening protocols, equips these individuals with a varied arsenal designed to overwhelm our defenses. Adding to these concerns are China’s national security laws, in- cluding its 2017 national intelligence law and recently-revised counterespionage law which require all Chinese citizens and orga- nizations to support state intelligence activities. Coupled with Chi- na’s well-documented history of conducting extraterritorial oper- ations in the United States and elsewhere, these Chinese laws pose a significant threat, turning innocent individuals into tools of espio- nage under immense pressure from China’s government. Amidst this orchestrated chaos Chinese transnational criminal organizations are also ruthlessly exploiting our border vulnerabilities, fueling the fentanyl crisis that claims thousands of American lives each year, showcasing a sinister blend of state- sponsored subterfuge and underworld criminality. Beyond the clear security risks, China is also skillfully exploiting today’s chaos to depict the United States as a faltering democracy incapable of securing its borders. This narrative, projected globally, not only diminishes our international standing but also bolsters China’s robust efforts to undermine Western democratic values. All the while, China’s government remains intent on obscuring the re- ality that its own citizens are fleeing China in search of freedom and opportunity elsewhere.21 In response to these threats we must not only do more to secure our borders, but also strengthen our diplomatic ties and enhance our technological capabilities. These efforts should be com- plemented by targeted legislative actions that provide the nec- essary tools and resources to combat these threats effectively. A coordinated response must include everything from enhancing our border security infrastructure, improving interagency collabora- tion, and boosting our intelligence capabilities to preempt and dis- mantle the networks facilitating these illegal migration flows. Washington must also intensify its public diplomacy and counter- propaganda efforts to correct Beijing’s misleading narratives. Such work is particularly important in light of a recent speech Chinese Communist Party Chairman Xi Jinping delivered to party elites in which he remarked, ‘‘The most important characteristic of the world is in a word chaos, and this trend appears likely to con- tinue.’’ In that seems speech Xi Jinping noted, ‘‘The times and trends are on our side.’’ As we consider these and other measures let us remember that the stakes are exceptionally high. The integrity of our borders, the safety of our citizens, including Asian Americans and Chinese Americans, and the stability of our global standing are all inter- twined with how we handle this growing crisis. I look forward to working together in developing bipartisan solu- tions that not only address the current challenges we face but also reinforce our national resilience against all forms of geopolitical manipulation and repression. On behalf of the Foundation for De- fense of Democracies, I thank you again for inviting me to testify today.

STATEMENT OF MEREDITH OYEN, PH.D., ASSOCIATE PRO- FESSOR, DEPARTMENT OF HISTORY, UNIVERSITY OF MARY- LAND, BALTIMORE COUNTY Ms. OYEN. Thank you, Chairman Bishop, Ranking Member Ivey, and the Members of the subcommittee for the invitation to share some historical context to the current increased levels of Chinese immigration. My name is Meredith Oyen, I am an associate pro-35 fessor of history at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, as well as the director of the Asian Studies program there. My research centers on the role that migrants play in the rela- tionship between the United States and China with particular focus on the period since the founding of the People’s Republic in 1949. Recent Chinese history does provide some explanations for the demographics in increased numbers of Chinese migrants on the Southern Border. Motivations for Chinese migrants crossing the Southern Border include the slowing Chinese economy and tightening political con- trol under President Xi Jinping. The pandemic and China’s lengthy zero-COVID policy had important effects on the Chinese national economy that led to slower growth and increased discontent. Migrants who have talked and been interviewed at the border have cited the difficulty finding jobs and the impact of the pan- demic on small business. Migrants also cite the tightening political control by President Xi Jinping that has led to political repression, police visits after making statements critical of the CCP or Chinese government, and a lack of freedom as reasons for leaving China. Specifically in the last decade, increasing persecution of Chinese Christians and Muslims, along with limitations on the exercise of their faith, has led some Chinese to leave the country. The crackdowns against protests in Hong Kong and the new na- tional security law implemented in 2020 has also led to the flight of former Hong Kong residents. The end of the zero-COVID policy in December 2022 permitted more Chinese nationals to travel abroad than had been able to since the beginning of the pandemic. Modern information sharing through social media and on-line platforms has provided informa- tion about crossing the U.S. Southern Border. As the number of people who cross successfully into the United States increase and they share their experiences, more individuals looking for a viable path follow in their footsteps. Recent reports have highlighted the demographics of the Chinese migrants. I wanted to add that before 1965 migration to the United States was dominated by men traveling alone. This was a result of the Page Act of 1875 which curtailed the migration of women and cultural traditions in China that made the international migration a risk only undertaken by men. More recently, unauthorized Chinese migration through con- tainer shipping, such as the Golden Venture incident that made headlines in the 1990’s, was also dominated by men traveling alone. Like their predecessors, these men were not necessarily sin- gle, but they were traveling solo hoping to pave the way for fami- lies that followed. Chinese immigrants, especially unauthorized immigrants, have long fallen under suspicion of having dangerous motives or being potential spies for a hostile foreign power. The Chinese became the first and only nation to be singled out in U.S. immigration law with the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act. The anti-Chinese movement that precipitated the act cited Chi- nese migration as a unique threat to the United States. These fears led to extreme violence against Chinese immigrants, including mob violence and the burning of Chinatowns.36 After 1949, Chinese nationals in the United States and visa ap- plicants in Hong Kong faced suspicion and harassment from U.S. authorities concerned about the national security risk they posed. U.S. Counsel Everett Drumright warned that the history of unau- thorized entry and particularly the history of lying about identities and lying about their background information meant the entire population was rife for opportunities for spying for the newly Com- munist government. The search for spies among Chinese immigrants and the Chinese American community had a chilling effect, and the community in the United States had and faced increased harassment and dis- crimination with no real evidence of spying being found. During the 1990’s, Taiwanese-American scientist Wen Ho Lee was arrested and held for over a year over espionage charges that never had enough clear evidence of a crime to bring charges against him. During the COVID pandemic there were many docu- mented instances of suspicion, harassment, and violence against Chinese Americans as their race and ethnicity became associated with the source of the pandemic that caused such significant eco- nomic and personal harm. Historically, there have been many examples of a impact of sus- picion, broad suspicion targeted specifically at Chinese Americans that have had detrimental effects for the community that is other- wise a very productive and useful community in the United States. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Ms. Oyen follows:] PREPARED STATEMENT OF MEREDITH OYEN THURSDAY, MAY 14, 2024, 2 O’CLOCK PM ET Thank you to the subcommittee for the invitation to share my knowledge of this situation. My name is Meredith Oyen. I am an associate professor of history at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. At UMBC, I am also the director of the Asian Studies Program. My research centers on the role that migrants play in the relationship between the United States and China, with particular focus on the pe- riod since the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949. Today I am happy to be here to offer some historical context for the issue of Chinese nationals crossing into the United States on the Southern Border, a topic I have recently written about for the on-line publication The Conversation.1 As with many other nationalities, there is a long history of unauthorized Chinese migrants coming to the United States. What has drawn significant attention re- cently is the extent to which this migration is coming over the Southern Border, and coming via a route that begins in South America and continues through the Darien Gap. This route for entry into the United States is dangerous for the migrants un- dertaking it. But in 2023 there was a marked increase in the numbers of Chinese nationals coming this way. In this statement, I hope to address some of the reasons for this increase, as well as offer some context for it in the larger patterns of Chi- nese migration. According to Pew Research, as of 2021 there were approximately 375,000 unau- thorized Chinese immigrants in the United States.2 That is a small percentage of the more than 5 million ethnic Chinese who reside in the United States. The most common paths for unauthorized Chinese immigrants to enter the United States in recent decades has been by overstaying a lawful tourist, business, or student visa. 1 ‘‘Chinese Migration to US is Nothing New—But the Reasons for Recent Surge at Southern Border Are,’’ The Conversation (March 11, 2024), https://theconversation.com/chinese-migra- tion-to-us-is-nothing-new-but-the-reasons-for-recent-surge-at-southern-border-are-223530. 2 Jeffrey S. Passel and Jens Manuel Korgstad, ‘‘What we know about unauthorized immi- grants living in the U.S.,’’ Pew Research Center (Nov. 16, 2023), https://www.pewresearch.org/ short-reads/2023/11/16/what-we-know-about-unauthorized-immigrants-living-in-the-us/ #:?:text=The%20largest%20increases%20were%20from,India%20(725%2C000).37 Visa approval rates for Chinese nationals applying to visit the United States tempo- rarily have been high in recent decades.3 For some migrants, however, the wait for a visa can be long, or the outcome un- certain. In these cases, there is a clear upward trend of Chinese nationals following many other nationalities in making use of the established routes through the Amer- icas to reach the Southern Border of the United States. Based on recent media reports, motivations for Chinese migrants crossing the Southern Border include the slowing Chinese economy and tightening political con- trol under President Xi Jinping. The pandemic and China’s lengthy ‘‘Zero-Covid’’ policy had important effects on the Chinese national economy that has led to slower growth and increased.4 Migrants who have talked to reporters at the border have cited the difficulty finding jobs and the impact of the pandemic on small busi- nesses.5 The tightening political control by President Xi Jinping is visible both through the unprecedented third term for Xi as Party Secretary that was decided in the Twentieth Party Congress in October 2022 as well as the recent sessions of the National People’s Congress.6 Migrants often cite political repression, police visits after making critical statements of the CCP or Chinese government, and a lack of freedom as reasons for leaving China.7 The trip to the United States via the Southern Border is expensive for Chinese migrants. They must pay for air travel, often routing through countries like Thai- land, Turkey, and Ecuador that do not require Chinese nationals to obtain visas prior to arrival.8 The trip often also involves paying local cartels or people smug- glers known as ‘‘snakeheads’’ to arrange for safe passage through the Darien Gap and/or to an entry point on the Southern U.S. Border.9 As a result, many of the migrants apprehended in the last year have come from China’s expansive middle class. Though Chinese migrants have long come to the United States, the growth in numbers on the Southern Border particularly is unusual, and the timing has raised questions about the reasons for the sudden increase. There are several reasonable explanations for why the numbers might have increased when they did. The first is the end of the Zero-Covid policy in 2022, which permitted more Chinese nationals to travel abroad than had been able to since the beginning of the pandemic. On- line discussions have referred to ‘‘runxue’’ or ‘‘run philosophy’’ as a way of talking about emigrating from China after harsh lockdowns in 2022.10 The decision to un- dertake this route is also a product of modern information sharing through social media and on-line platforms. Many migrants who felt an urgency to leave China cited videos on the Chinese version of TikTok called Douyin, or on TikTok itself, as well as other social media outlets, as having provided the information they needed 3 In fiscal year 2023 a total of 417,008 Nonimmigrant Visas were issued to nationals from China. In the same year, the B visa refusal rate was at 26.62 percent, down from fiscal year 2022 and the fiscal year 2021 spike of 79.09 percent. That said, the current refusal rate is much higher than it was a decade prior, when it was 8.5 percent in fiscal year 2023.

A further motivation comes from the fact that Chinese nationals who enter the United States and apply for asylum have also been more successful than many other nationalities, given the valid concerns they express about political repression or the lack of freedom to practice Christianity in China.12 The lack of cooperation between the United States and China on effecting deportations—something that was en- demic to the relationship in the 1950’s through 1970’s and has ebbed and flowed in the years since—has ensured that even those not granted the right to remain in the United States would not be able to be returned to China. That situation is start- ing to change, and as deportations increase, they might begin to affect the numbers of people arriving.13 Recent reports have highlighted the demographics of the Chinese migrants. Most of the unauthorized migrants crossing the Southern Border have been single adults traveling alone, and although public statistics do not account for gender, many who have been interviewed have been men. This is one area in which knowledge of his- tory and culture can provide some reassurance. Before 1965, migration to the United States was dominated by men traveling alone. Very often they have not been single men, but men with families who travel first, undertaking the greater dangers of the trip with the hope of bringing family members to join them once established. This pattern was established in the earliest days of Chinese migration to the United States beginning in the 1850’s: ‘‘Chinese American communities were predominately made up of men—more than half of them married—during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries . . . Chinese women did immigrate to the United States, but their num- bers were small. During the nineteenth century, the traditional Chinese patriarchal family system discouraged and even forbade ‘decent’ women from traveling abroad. The harsh living conditions in California, high levels of anti-Chinese violence, ex- pensive transpacific transportation, and the lack of available jobs for women were also factors that discouraged Chinese women from immigrating.’’14 Since the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act did away with National Origins quotas and gave preference to family reunification and skill-based visas, legal mi- gration from China has skewed female, with the result of the overall demographics of Chinese immigrants in the United States trending majority female.15 However, just as in the earliest periods of migration, dangerous routes for unau- thorized migrants are dominated by men. In the 1990’s there were many concerns about unauthorized Chinese migrants arriving in the United States after being smuggled into U.S. ports via shipping containers on cargo ships. In 1993, the cargo ship The Golden Venture ran aground outside the Port of New York, and 286 un- documented migrants from China’s Fujian Province who had been aboard were dis- covered, some swimming for their lives for the U.S. shore. The survivors numbered 262 men and 24 women.16 Overwhelmingly, the migrants seeking refuge in the United States after undertaking an arduous voyage to get there were men traveling alone. It would not be surprising that Chinese migrants undergoing the route through the Darien Gap to the United States would be majority male, if in fact they are. History also demonstrates that there is precedent to fearing Chinese migrants. The Chinese became the first and only nation to be singled out in U.S. immigration law with the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act, which banned the migration of Chinese laborers to the United States. The Exclusion Act was extended several times and made ‘‘permanent’’ until its ultimate repeal in 1943 in recognition of Chinese co- operation as an ally in World War Two.

Those acts in turn resulted in rising levels of unauthorized Chinese migration, as migrants sought ways around the discriminatory measures. During the decades of Exclusion, a black market of Chinese-American identities emerged that allowed in- dividuals to circumvent immigration laws. Additionally, Chinese migrants during this period sometimes crossed the southern U.S. border to enter the United States.18 After the People’s Republic of China was established in 1949, direct migration be- tween the Chinese mainland and the United States was severely curtailed until the reopening of relations in the 1970’s. During that period, though, Chinese nationals in the United States faced suspicion and harassment from U.S. authorities con- cerned about the national security risk they posed. Whereas Eastern European de- fectors were often assumed to be freedom-seeking, Chinese nationals with families still in China behind the ‘‘bamboo curtain’’ came under intense scrutiny. The history of unauthorized migration and forged documentation during the Exclusion Era cre- ated the impetus for FBI raids on Chinatown organizations, arrests, and harass- ment of Chinese migrants who did not support Chiang Kai-shek’s Republic of China regime. Sending remittances home to family was criminalized under the Trading with the Enemy Act, and Chinese scholars and scientists in the United States when the Korean War broke out came under suspicion as potential spies.19 Most famously, Chinese scientist Qian Xuesen was harassed enough to decide to return to China, despite earlier plans to remain permanently in the United States, and once returned he became an important public figure in support of Chinese leader Mao Zedong and in the development of the Silkworm missile.20 Even after normalization of relations and the reopening of regular paths of immi- gration, Chinese migrants have been repeatedly brought under suspicion of threat- ening national security and economic strength for little reason other than their eth- nicity. In 1982, Chinese immigrant Vincent Chin was murdered in Detroit by 2 un- employed auto workers after getting into an altercation at a bar. The men who at- tacked him were heard to invoke fears of Japanese economic success to the det- riment of the American worker.21 During the 1990’s, Taiwanese American scientist Wen Ho Lee was arrested and held for over a year over espionage charges that never had enough clear evidence to try, much less convict him.22 During the Covid Pandemic, there were many documented instances of suspicion, harassment, and vi- olence against Chinese Americans, as their race and ethnicity became associated with the source of the pandemic that caused such significant economic and personal harm.23 Chairman BISHOP.

Riddell, and Alex R. Piquero, ‘‘Anti-Asian Hate Crimes Spike During the Early Stages of the COVID–19 Pandemic,’’ Journal of Interpersonal Violence 38.3–4 (Feb 2023), 3513–3533.40 As I speak with you at this minute, Chinese nationals are ille- gally crossing our Southwest Border in historic numbers and pre- paring for their second crime, asylum fraud. They disfigure and toss their passports like this one because the stamps inside prove their holders passed through safe countries that would have grant- ed protection. That would disqualify them for U.S. asylum. Likewise, they discard Mexican residency cards like these all over the U.S. side and the Mexican side which the Mexicans re- quire for them to move north because they show that Mexico al- ready granted them protection, which is another disqualifier for asylum. A record-smashing 50,000 Chinese nationals have crossed the Southern Border since Biden entered office and stood up policies that mainline them into interior America within 48 hours. The Chi- nese people responded predictably to this unprecedented invitation. At current escalating rates, their numbers should hit 100,000 by 2024’s end. All of China knows they will be freed on personal recog- nizance for years and likely remain permanently. This administration tolerates mass illegal entry and asylum fraud, but we are here today because the administration seems equally accommodating to a direct national security threat this human flow poses. That would be China’s relentless economic and political espionage campaigns, thievery of cutting-edge defense technologies, and dissident suppression operations against our citi- zens and legal residents. To be sure, most of those 50,000 Chinese nationals are merely coming to work and enjoy America’s famed lifestyle, but there can be little doubt that Beijing’s spy masters also noticed right away when a welcome wagon greeted the first of its 50,000 citizens that America’s new President had just opened a new superhighway over the U.S. Southwest Border, tailor-built to carry intelligence operatives. U.S. counterintelligence agencies must assume Beijing is already injecting agents into this flow. Recent spy prosecutions in the U.S. and public intelligence community assessments tell us this threat is not speculative. The prosecutions revealed young 20-something agents got in by exploiting U.S. student and cultural exchange visas. They heisted our secrets from inside and elite U.S. universities, research institutes, and corporations. It follows that the prosecu- tions put heat on legal visa abuses and drove up the risk of detec- tion to China. Just when an alternative way to get its operatives in, the Biden government handed China the golden ticket, warm greetings at the border and rapid releases with almost no questions asked. The U.S. intelligence community’s own assessments tell us what is in store. China will remain the most aggressive espionage actor on U.S. soil and has big plans. Biden’s own 2024 DHS threat as- sessment predicts much more than rapacious economic espionage. It says the CCP operatives will hunt down dissidents in America and will use ‘‘physical assault, threats, harassment, defamation, and kidnapping out of country,’’ read rendition, to ‘‘suppress opposi- tional voices.’’41 Almost unbelievably, Beijing already has established inside the United States what the DHS assessment called police stations from which CCP operatives surveil and harass dissidents. About those 50,000 nonspy, economic migrants can they all be regarded as en- tirely benevolent, asylum fraud aside? They are fodder for coerced recruitment by China. Office of Director of National Intelligence assessments 2023 and 2024 say China is going to ‘‘pressure families back home to recruit Chinese abroad as informants and operatives.’’ As if quick releases after border crossings were not golden ticket enough, the Biden ad- ministration gifted the Chinese intelligence an especially sparkling new policy. Washington ordered Border Patrol to reduce the num- ber of interview questions for incoming Chinese nationals from 40 to just 5, the Daily Caller has reported. Why? To move them into the country even faster, including those who tossed their identity documents and might as well have given their names as Mickey Mouse. Reporting indicates they have all learned to easily defeat the 5 questions and be shown the entrance door to America, which makes them all strangers, just the way Bei- jing’s spy masters wanted. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. Bensman follows:]4243444546474849505152535455565758596061626364 Chairman BISHOP. Thank you, Mr. Bensman. I thank the witnesses for your valuable testimony, and let’s see, where is my place? We have got—oh, I am sorry. We are here. Members will be recognized by order of seniority for their 5 min- utes of questioning. An additional round of questioning may be called after all Members have been recognized. I now recognize myself for 5 minutes of questioning. Professor Oyen, I think I will start with you. You talked about risk. In fact, Mr. Ivey opened his comments with commentary about risks of Asians being discriminated against or Chinese being discriminated against. Of course, we know that there is some very difficult his- tory in the United States of that sort.65 So what of that? I mean, what are you saying there? What have you got? Let me just tick off some of the risks that have been spe- cifically identified in other witnesses’ testimony. I have always understood and lots of evidence before this Con- gress indicates that China is engaged in very intensive economic espionage against the United States. We have heard testimony. I recited in my opening statement about the aggressive Chinese money-laundering operations in the United States. Mr. Bensman just made reference to in news reports it has been wide-spread, including one in North Carolina I heard about, about Chinese ‘‘police stations,’’ which are bent on intimidating, harassing, and in some cases—well, many awful things against folks of Chinese heritage in the United States. We have heard about cultural exchange programs and college campuses being used as Trojan horses for a Chinese intelligence in- filtration. Then you have got a rapidly-increasing population of Chinese migrants coming in irregularly. So what about all that? Should that be just ignored or is it a good thing, perhaps? Ms. OYEN. I would say neither. I mean, I am suggesting that in the grand scheme of history you can see that this kind of migration and these kinds of concerns have existed before, that the concerns about security risks from irregular migration are not new. That there are plenty of valid concerns about the relationship with China and the kinds of Chinese espionage that might be hap- pening. I am saying, though, that I do not have any—I have not seen anything that suggests that this particular population is part of this espionage network. There is no definitive evidence one way or the other. Chairman BISHOP. So do you think there needs to be definitive evidence in the case of every—— Ms. OYEN. I think there needs to be. Well, I mean this is not up to me to say. This is I am a historian, right? I am not a policy maker. But because there is no definitive evidence either way I would caution against this broad-scale assumption that people who are seeking asylum in the United States are, in fact, spies coming to undermine it when there are, in fact, very good other expla- nations and there are also lots of historical precedents for that kind of rhetoric having very negative effects on the existing Chinese- American community. So I think that the history leads us to have some caution in how we speak about this population coming in. Chairman BISHOP. So is it a question of how we speak about it or what we are doing to vet them? Do you think they should be vet- ted intensively? Ms. OYEN. I think every immigrant who comes into the United States should be vetted, but that is part of the—— Chairman BISHOP. I certainly agree with that. They are not being, so let’s let that and set that aside. Would you say that there are additional risks with China as a global adversary of the United States that would warrant additional intensive vetting for Chinese migrants who are entering without legal authorization?66 Ms. OYEN. I think that historically we have seen that it is at pe- riods of high tension between the United States and China we have engaged in greater vetting, but we have also seen historically that the patterns of the people who are engaged with espionage have not been economic migrants—— Chairman BISHOP. Yes. Ms. OYEN [continuing]. Who are. In fact, the 1950’s era or even the 1900’s era people and the 1990’s era migrants who came in by irregular means were not coming in that way. Chairman BISHOP. OK. Ms. OYEN. I think that knowing that history is important. Chairman BISHOP. I got you. I don’t want to cut you off but let me get to Mr. Bensman before we get done. So how about that, Mr. Bensman? If I am hearing from the Ranking Member and Professor Oyen’s ideas, we really shouldn’t say anything about this because it is going to be discriminatory. What about that? Why isn’t that true? Or if it is true, what do you say about it? Mr. BENSMAN. Well, the U.S.—excuse me—the U.S. Homeland Security enterprise, especially in dealing with the border, has for decades isolated particular nationalities based on our relations with their governments, for example, Iran. When we have immi- grants from Iran hit the border we will set them aside and bring in the FBI and CIA and others to interview them to try to figure out, you know, what they are about. Are they good? Are they are they fleeing the regime or are they part of the regime? Are they a terrorist actor? North Koreans that hit the border, I mean, everybody can under- stand why a North Korean would want to leave North Korea, but we also know North Korea is a source of mischief all over the world and they are sending their representatives. So we do separate cer- tain nationalities as a matter of routine—— Chairman BISHOP. Yes. Mr. BENSMAN [continuing]. From all of the Middle Eastern coun- tries and it just depends on. But China most certainly we did all the way up until about last year. Chairman BISHOP. Perhaps we will have another round. I am conscious of having overstayed my time. So the Ranking Member, I will—no, no. Mr. IVEY. You have one more question? Chairman BISHOP. Well, I think I will. I will do—— Mr. IVEY. We are not beating—— Chairman BISHOP. I appreciate that, Mr. Ranking Member. Mr. IVEY [continuing]. The bushes for—— Chairman BISHOP. Right, and I appreciate it. Oh, I appreciate it and thank you for that indulgence. Yes, let me follow it up in this way. I do think it is correct to say there is a nationality concern here that is predicated on a hos- tile relationship of governments that counsels additional concern but let me just file this last question for maybe Mr. Bensman. I always hear from the Secretary of Homeland Security we have a global, you know, eruption of migration that accounts for all of this. Other than the possibility that—and maybe Mr. Hankinson led with this assorted—and I will probably—maybe I will direct the question Mr. Hankinson. I am not aware of any major change in67 China that would account for this sudden explosion of Chinese ille- gal migrants. There is a lot of government totalitarian control in that country and even in terms of people leaving the country. So is there something I am missing? Is there some, you know, chaos that has erupted in China that would account for this sudden change, a large change? Mr. BENSMAN. Well, I spend a lot of time with the immigrants. I have interviewed thousands of them. I have met Chinese. I can never get the Chinese to talk to me. I have an interpretation app which is difficult anyway, but I don’t think that they would want to talk to me. But what I gather from my interviews with many thousands of immigrants on their way here is that they are coming now because all their friends got in. All their relatives just got in. The border is open. We are going for it. Well, like, what if the Americans changed their minds all of a sudden, and so there is this big rush on? I have to say that the Chinese are probably no different. They are going to be looking for lifestyle upgrades. A lot of the Chinese that I meet on the trail seem very well-resourced, very well put to- gether. They don’t seem like they are starving peasants. They often spend tens of thousands of dollars to make the jour- ney. It is an opportunity for them. Now, the economy in China is not, you know, as robust as it has been but they can get in now. Chairman BISHOP. Thank you, Mr. Bensman. Again, I think the Ranking Member for his indulgence and I will exercise similar indulgence. I yield to—or I recognize Mr. Ivey for 5 minutes of questioning and whatever else, too. Mr. IVEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate that. I want to separate the apples and oranges out here because we have got sort-of two conversations about migration. One is the Southwestern Border, people crossing like a lot of the other people coming from countries, Central America and the like. The other is the economic espionage crowd which, as I understand it, is not crossing at the border. These are people who are coming over on visas and the like. The main difference I am told, I was just in a conference on AI where we were talking a lot about the competition between the United States and China and the concern that China is catching us and has passed us potentially on some of these areas with re- spect to AI and tech. Some of it is based on economic espionage. Some of it is also based on the fact that I think they have 5 times more engineers and computer scientists than the United States has, which is why we bring so many of them over. But one of the points that was made was that 38 percent of the tech scientists in the United States are from China. Those are not people who came here, you know, that came across the border with no documents or falsified documents. They were people who were brought here by their companies. In fact, if you talk to some of these companies they will tell you they are having trouble bringing people over. They need them be- cause of the engineering and scientific expertise. They have trouble68 bringing them over because of the visa process here in the United States. In some instances they said, I talked to one VC leader who said that he was trying to bring somebody over from India. It took so long that what he did instead was he just set up a satellite com- pany in Canada and started bringing him over there. So in some respects, it is not of, you know, people coming over here too fast for these types of jobs here in the United States. They are not coming fast enough for these tech leaders who want to have them here. So I did want to make sure, and I don’t know if I am disputing what you said, Mr. Bensman, or not, but I think it is pretty clear cut that the people coming across the border who don’t have—even if they have a technical background if they don’t have the docu- ments Microsoft is not going to hire them. Google is not going to hire them. You know, they are not going to get those kinds of jobs. They are not going to be professors at Stanford or Harvard or wherever. You can’t just come over here and show up one day and get a job. So the economic, yes, and that is where the economic espionage is happening. It is happening at that level. It is not happening at the level where people are crossing the border, as I am told by peo- ple who, (A), work at the border but also, more importantly, own and run those companies where they are complaining most loudly about the economic espionage. So the focus they want us to make is in part focused on the Chi- nese government, which sponsors a lot of that activity and also where there are technology responses aimed at protecting the infor- mation and better ways and vetting internally to make sure the right people have the access to that information. Mr. Singleton, I think you mentioned something about tools for espionage as well with respect to, I guess, crossing at the South- west Border. I would raise the same kind of questions that I did just a moment ago. But you also said something about things that Congress can do to address these problems, and I think it is I am going to set aside the economic espionage piece for the reasons I just stated. I think you mentioned something about improving infrastructure for vet- ting and the like at the border? I wanted to give you a chance to elaborate on that. Mr. SINGLETON. Thank you very much. I would agree with you that the vast majority of Chinese nationals who live and study in the United States stay and contribute to our communities. We also have to recognize, however, that there are large numbers, thou- sands of Chinese nationals who are coming here to from China to study at our universities at the behest, direction, and with the sponsorship under the Chinese Communist Party in support of military civil fusion and its broader strategy. So enhancing those established, legal mechanisms to both vet at U.S. embassies and consulates to allow them in, but also recog- nizing the threat that exists in that legal immigration space is crit- ical. I think many of the—— Mr. IVEY. Well, let me ask you on how to bulk that up. How would you address that?69 Mr. SINGLETON. Having also been a former consular officer I can acknowledge the amount of time that you have to adjudicate a visa for a particular entrant is minuscule, sometimes 30 seconds or less to make a decision about a particular student. One of the things that needs to be done is a much broader understanding of the Chi- nese universities that are involved in military civil fusion and add- ing additional scrutiny for those students. To give great examples, my alma mater, Texas A&M, used to maintain research partnerships with China’s Ocean University which is responsible for constructing Chinese military submarines. Other Chinese universities like Sichuan University develop China’s nuclear weapons, and yet we allow high-level STEM-related re- search partnerships between those two schools that are wholly un- regulated. As a consular officer, I am wholly unequipped to make a decision about whether that individual represents a threat. So it really does require us to recognize how China has tapped into its civilian uni- versity structure to in effect weaponize it. Mr. IVEY. On that point, and I appreciate you for letting me run over, Mr. Chairman, with respect to tech companies so you men- tioned sort-of the academic community. Are there similar sorts of issues with respect to the high-tech community as well? Mr. SINGLETON. There have been a number of documented in- stances in which that has occurred, but again, I do—— Mr. IVEY. Give me an example. Mr. SINGLETON. Sure. I mean, I think that there have been sev- eral serious FBI indictments in the last 4 years that talk about the placement of Chinese nationals in high-tech companies, particu- larly in Silicon Valley, and then that those individuals are sending back research, not public information, back to Chinese individuals and universities. There is also occurring—— Mr. IVEY. Well, let me stop you there. Did they not go through a vetting process or—— Mr. SINGLETON. I think it shows that our vetting process is cur- rently inadequate and that when those nationals do gain entrance and employment there is no follow-on screening. For example, if a Chinese national from a Chinese military civil fusion university were to matriculate at a U.S. school with their political science and then the next day change it to nuclear physics, there is no one monitoring that change in process. So it is both pre- and post-facto screening that is—— Mr. IVEY. Let me stick with the companies here for a second. So with respect to, I don’t know, Microsoft, since they will be here next week apparently or in the next few weeks, they hire somebody and they are not monitoring them or they don’t have internal con- trols with respect to protecting their confidential information? I mean—— Mr. SINGLETON. It is that we are talking about a completely hap- hazard process. Nothing is required in statute or required and even today Microsoft announced that it was moving thousands of its AI engineers outside of China, relocating them because of concerns about Chinese military civil fusion and the potential risks to losing critical cutting-edge technology because of Chinese espionage.70 Mr. IVEY. OK. All right. Mr. Chairman, thank you. I appreciate you for letting me run on. Chairman BISHOP. I thank the Ranking Member and I have, well, one nit to pick and I will give you an opportunity to respond if I can before we go on. There was a comment in your opening statement staff handed to me that one of the sector chiefs gave that testimony that, ‘‘We treat everybody the same. It doesn’t matter where you come from. It doesn’t matter what your nationality is or what your religious be- liefs are. We are going to treat everybody exactly the same.’’ But then immediately below that a question was asked, ‘‘Do you know if any additional investigation or interviews are conducted on Chinese nationals in U.S. sector?’’ ‘‘Yes.’’ ‘‘And that they are?’’ ‘‘Yes, that they are. Why?’’ Then I am skipping a little bit here but he says, ‘‘I have sector intelligence unit agents that are assigned to the FBI Joint Ter- rorism Task Force team and so FBI has expressed an interest in doing additional screening and interviews for Chinese nationals.’’ I yield back, yield to the Ranking Member. Mr. IVEY. Well, just an observation, I appreciate that clarification for me and correction, but I thought our panel was just testifying a few minutes ago that you only get 5 questions—— Chairman BISHOP. Yes. Mr. IVEY [continuing]. When they are coming in. So I am not sure which it is. Chairman BISHOP. I am not sure where it comes out either. Mr. IVEY. Yes. Chairman BISHOP. I think, but maybe we are in somewhat agree- ment. Maybe we are in agreement. I am not sure about if there is a need for more intensive vetting of Chinese nationals. Whether it is happening or not I am not totally clear. So I thank the Ranking Member again for the spirit of collegiality in which we do our subcommittee hearings and may it extend to the rest of Congress. But with that, I will recognize the gentleman from Mississippi, Mr. Ezell for 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. EZELL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Over the past year this committee has shown the failure of the Biden administration’s open border policies. Under the President’s watch there been over 8 million illegal aliens released into this country. But what is not clearly revealed in the group of 8 million illegals as an alarming statistics. The fastest-growing group crossing the border illegally is not from Mexico or South America. They are from China. Since President Biden has taken office, CBP encounters with Chinese nationals has risen over 4,200 percent. The CCP has tar- geted businesses, universities, and lawmakers and its efforts to un- dermine America. The thought that CCP would not use an open borders to their advantage is nonsense. Last year President Biden’s DHS released guidance that signifi- cantly reduced the vetting process of these Chinese nationals. The71 number of questions, what we talked about earlier, has gone from 40 to just 5. Mr. Hankinson, do you believe the Biden administration is mak- ing it any easier for the Chinese nationals to enter this country il- legally? Mr. HANKINSON. I do. Excuse me. Yes, I do. I think the charts and the graphs and the statistics are pretty clear that when people understand that they will be released once they arrive in the United States as long as they express a credible fear and intent to launch an asylum claim, and we do know that 85 percent, 90 per- cent of those claims are fraudulent, meaning that they are based on facts that just don’t generate a claim for asylum that will be ap- proved, then they come. With social media that has sort-of greatly magnified exponen- tially the information that is getting back to countries all around the world. I think we are up to, like, 180 countries now that have been caught entering illegally at the border in the last few years. So when you say that you are not going to detain people, when you are releasing them on their own recognizance, when you are paroling them in, and when they know that the system will not be able to process them for years, then you send a clear signal and people understand it. Mr. EZELL. Thank you. Do you know what 5 questions the Chi- nese nationals in the interview? Do you know what the 5 questions are? Mr. HANKINSON. Well, I have a completely unconfirmed snapshot of what they are, and they are just basic questions about where you come from? Do you have any affiliation with the Chinese gov- ernment? Did you pay for your trip to the United States? Did you pay a smuggler? Have you got any prior arrests? A shortened version of the form that visa applicants have to an- swer what you are supposed to say. I don’t have a criminal record. I am not a member of the Nazi Party or the Communist Party and so on. Mr. EZELL. Yes. So they just check it off so there is no real verification whether they are telling the truth or not? Mr. HANKINSON. There is absolutely no way to verify. If someone at the border says I don’t have a criminal record, we don’t have the criminal records of China easily accessible. If we ask the Chinese for them they wouldn’t give them to us I am pretty sure unless it was someone that they wanted back, for example a dissident. Mr. EZELL. Yes. When we do obtain any information and run it throughout the internal databases do you know if China is pro- viding any information on the aliens? Do you know if they are doing any of that? Mr. HANKINSON. You are asking if the Chinese share their—as far as I know, no. We have countries in the Visa Waiver Program that do share criminal records with us that that can be done auto- matically, but as far as I am aware there is no automatic data sharing with China of either fact data or bio data. Mr. EZELL. Do you have any opinion about President Biden and his policies? Is this putting America at a greater risk? Mr. HANKINSON. I think statistically it is undeniable. If you have 50,000 additional people and you have no confirmation of their72 background, their criminal records, their past affiliation or present affiliation with the government or any of its entities, I think it is almost certain that a proportion, probably very small, but a propor- tion of them are coming here with the intent to at some point do some harm. Mr. EZELL. Do you have any examples of any of these bad actors that have entered the country illegally? Mr. HANKINSON. Well, one recent example that struck me was in March of this year in 29 Palms in California. There was a Chinese man who, I think, had crossed the border illegally and been re- leased who attempted to get on to the military base. At the time the local headlines, the local press said he was confused and he said he was lost and he didn’t know where he was going. I wrote at the time in an op-ed that, geez, if you were going to try to scope out a base and try to get some basic intel and figure out what the security procedures were at U.S. military bases, what better way than to send some, excuse me, but a doofus. But then I later found out that there have been over 100 of these incidents by Chinese nationals in the past few years according to a source quoted by the Wall Street Journal. So one time maybe, but 100 times starts to seem a little bit more like a pattern. Mr. EZELL. Pretty obvious. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. Chairman BISHOP. I thank the gentleman for yielding back. I now represent—recognize the gentlelady, Mrs. Ramirez, for 5 minutes of questioning. Mrs. RAMIREZ. Thank you, Chairman and Ranking Member. I want to start by expressing my disappointment that this com- mittee still allows special witnesses from an organization that has been designated as a hate group for publishing the works of white nationalists. Mr. Bensman, yes or no, have you ever used or invoked invasion rhetoric or language when referencing migrants? Mr. BENSMAN. No, I have not. Mrs. RAMIREZ. OK. Well, let me ask you a follow-up. Is your Twitter handle @bensmantodd, correct? Mr. BENSMAN. Yes. Mrs. RAMIREZ. OK. So I want to show you here something. As you can see, I have a number of your Twitter posts here and it is not hard to find examples of you or someone who is doing a good job pretending to be you uplifting the same invasion rhetoric cen- tral to the white nationalist and anti-Semitic great replacement conspiracy theory. Let me read just one of them. ‘‘Border invasion series,’’ oh, let me read one more, one more, ‘‘Biden administration rechanneled migrant waves to hide invasion at Southern Border.’’ Folks, no one from a hate group should ever be invited to provide testimony before this committee. It hurts our integrity as a com- mittee and it is why as I am sitting here I am going to direct my questions to an actual expert. The Department of State’s 2023 human rights documents that significant human rights issues in China include credible reports of unlawful killings, forced disappearances, torture, and arbitrary de-73 tention by the Chinese government, forced labor, and genocide against ethnic minorities. So my question is to Dr. Oyen. It seems Chinese nationals seek- ing humanitarian relief have plenty to fear. Can you briefly speak to the human rights conditions and risks in China? Let me specifi- cally ask you how has the Chinese government increased repres- sion of its citizenry under President Xi? Ms. OYEN. There has been a tightening of controls since 2012 when President Xi first took power and in the recent years since he has become a essentially permanent leader that has increased as well. We have we have seen this. There is the long-standing, the longer history of the persecution of the Uyghur people, but there has also been very specific examples of Chinese and Muslim adher- ents to their faith not being permitted to worship in the ways that they choose. There has also been persecution of people who were part of some- thing that is called the Chinese Democratic Party. There was a pe- riod of open flourishing of ideas where people created ideas when talking about future plans for China and ways in which the Chi- nese government might serve people. And that the people who were part of that party and who were engaged in that have been largely subject to a crackdown where they have been arrested and harassed for their beliefs. In some cases have successfully sought asylum. So there is also just built into this last decade, 12 years of Xi Jinping’s rules, there has been a tightening of laws and control over the extent to which people can talk freely about the govern- ment, the ways that they criticize the government. There has been tightening of internet controls that already ex- isted, right, but there is continuing cracking down on internet con- trols. So certainly there are examples of the government being au- thoritarian and being hard on civilians such as that they might de- cide that they can’t live their lives or they can’t live their lives free of repression. Mrs. RAMIREZ. Thank you, Dr. Oyen. It seems to me, I mean, based on your testimony and even seeing what you submitted that we have to take seriously that there are Chinese nationals that are fleeing oppressive regimes. They are seeking refuge and humani- tarian relief and that those who flee authoritarian China are no different than all of those who flee oppressive regimes. Some of those asylum seekers were the ancestors of the people that are in this room right now, and it is unacceptable that in the middle of celebrating the contributions of our Asian American and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander communities here we are with rhetoric about Chinese immigrant invasion. I am not surprised, however, because a century ago the United States enacted the Immigration Act of 1924, a law that heavily in- fluenced by racist beliefs that close the door on immigration from Asia, building on the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, and here we are in this committee now. So with that on record, Chairman, I yield back. Chairman BISHOP. The gentlewoman yields back.74 I now recognize the gentleman from Alabama, Mr. Strong, for 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. STRONG. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to talk more about the points Mr. Ezell mentioned. Mr. Bensman, most of the Chinese migrants that illegally entered the United States at the Southwest Border are first-timers and there- fore they do not have any flags in the U.S. criminal database. The CCP does not share criminal information with U.S. law en- forcement. I will emphasize that unless our intelligence agencies have a reason to flag a migrant all CBP can do is rely on a mi- grant’s story. Most Chinese migrants state that they are here to claim asylum or for economic reasons. From a national security perspective, is re- lying only on a migrant’s word enough to determine whether the migrant came to the United States with nefarious intent? What types of risk does this blind reliance pose? Mr. BENSMAN. Thank you. First of all, I would like to recommend a book to Mrs. Ramirez, ‘‘Making Hate Pay,’’ by Tyler O’Neil, ‘‘The corruption of the Southern Poverty Law Center.’’ I also want to tell you, Ms. Ramirez, that as far as I don’t know what you have on your board, I would like to study it, there is no hateful anti-Semitic speech in my Twitter feed. I am Jewish, and we don’t really get with white nationalists. That is not our thing so get your facts straight. As far as your—— Mrs. RAMIREZ. Mr. Chairman, he is referring to me so I just won- dered—— Chairman BISHOP. It is the gentleman’s time from Alabama. Mr. STRONG. Thank you, sir. Let’s go back to that question. What type of risk does the blind reliance pose? Mr. BENSMAN. What type of risk does—— Mr. STRONG. What type of risk does this blind reliance related to national security, just what—if they tell us they are great peo- ple, that is what we are doing at our border right now. Oh, I want to come to America. What does this pose whenever they say come on in? Mr. BENSMAN. Well, it is the ultimate stranger danger at the bor- der. That is our problem with having mass migration at these his- toric levels. We can’t know who anyone is. We can’t really go to the Chinese, as I think my colleague said, for an intel share. We can’t go to really very many countries at all for an intel share. Mr. STRONG. Thank you. What ways can CBP potentially reduce that risk? Mr. BENSMAN. Well, there is not a whole lot they can do. They will run text database checks. They will maybe run some criminal history checks and then they will let them in. But if they haven’t been in the United States to commit crimes in the past there is not going to be—they are going to come up with a negative, right? It will be a big blank. So you just have to, kind-of, take their word for it. A lot of them, like I said, dump their ID documents, their passports, and say my name is Mickey Mouse.75 Mr. STRONG. OK. I know that Russia invaded Ukraine and the Ukrainians defended itself. Hamas invaded Israel and Israel de- fended itself. The United States is being invaded, and I think that is the right word, by 160 different countries, and this administra- tion has done nothing. Ten million illegal aliens coming across the border. I will say this again. This fentanyl is going to kill a generation of Americans. It is not a Republican issue. It is not a Democratic issue. It is an American issue. I will also bring up what is happening right now at the border. Border security for every drone they are flying the Mexican cartel is flying 17. They are coming into U.S. air space bringing fentanyl, 60 pounds, 80 pounds, 100 pounds at a time, and we are doing nothing. Killing a generation of Americans. You have mentioned some of the questions that are asked. You know, it is almost comical the questions. You know, why don’t they ask them what kind of chewing gum do they like or their favorite city in America or their favorite color because they are getting the intelligence of the questions they are asking is about as important as that. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Chairman BISHOP. The gentleman yields back. I now recognize the gentlelady from New York, I believe, right, Ms. Clarke. Ms. CLARKE. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and I thank our Ranking Member. I want to yield some time to my colleague, Mrs. Ramirez of Illinois. Mrs. RAMIREZ. Thank you, Congresswoman Clarke. Just to follow up from the remarks that the witness just made, so I said the orga- nization and then I said your Tweets, and we will be happy to give you a printout. There are so many of them so you will have an op- portunity to read them closely after committee. But I want to make sure that—Mr. Chairman, I want to enter this into the record which is a article from the Southern Poverty Law Center that ranks immigrant studies as one of the white na- tionalist organizations. Mr. STRONG. I object. Mrs. RAMIREZ. OK. Well, then let me see if I can enter this court record here that where the Center for Immigration Studies filed a case against the Southern Poverty Law Center, but the courts actu- ally found this to—they dismissed the motion because there was not enough information to be able to determine that they had a case against them. Mr. IVEY. Mr. Chairman, I would move to include in the record both of the documents that the gentlelady from Illinois has offered. Chairman BISHOP. I had been so moved. Is there a motion at the table? Mr. STRONG. Motion. Chairman BISHOP. A motion before—there is no debate on that motion? All in favor of the motion on the table, say aye. All opposed, say no. I hear the motion to have been approved and the—— Mr. STRONG. I would ask for a recorded vote, Mr. Chairman.76 Chairman BISHOP. It is a recorded vote. All in favor, let’s see, we have to—the Clerk will call the roll. Ms. CLARKE. Mr. Chairman, I did yield my time to Mrs. Ramirez. Since we are going through this process, I hope that my time will be restored. Mr. IVEY. I would ask the Chair to pause the clock at where was stopped. Chairman BISHOP. It appears to me the clerk pause the clock at 3:15, which I assume is pursuant to the rule. Ms. CLARKE. Well, it was actually about 4 minutes—— Chairman BISHOP. Well—— Mr. IVEY. When the objection came. Chairman BISHOP. I am going to—if they are able to establish what the time was I have no problem with putting it back as it was, but the request was not made until now. Mr. IVEY. Well, let’s do the vote, but I would suggest to the Chair that we have been fairly flexible on time going both ways today. Chairman BISHOP. I concur about that. Mr. IVEY. All right, thank you. Chairman BISHOP. The clerk will call the roll. The CLERK. Ms. Greene of Georgia. Sorry. Ms. Greene of Georgia. [No response.] The CLERK. Mr. Ezell. [No response.] The CLERK.

The CLERK. On that vote, Mr. Chairman, there were 2 ayes and 3 noes. Chairman BISHOP. The motion on the table fails. The motion be- fore the committee is the motion—or the motion of the gentleman, the Ranking Member, to admit the item into the record. All in favor will say aye. All opposed, no.77 The noes have it.

The time is with the gentlelady of New York. Ms. CLARKE. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. We are here today because Republicans are demagoguing and ex- ploiting the xenophobic and white supremacist ideologies that are fueling the immigration debate in this Nation. For those who are showing up at our border I am concerned about how we as a Nation are going to address what is basically a broken immigration system. People don’t choose to leave their families and communities, their culture, their language on a whim. Most often people leave because their very lives are at stake.129 Just 700 miles from our border, the Nation of Haiti is facing an unprecedented crisis. Gangs control their capital city, Port-au- Prince, and every-day citizens are being terrorized by brutal mur- derers and kidnappings. Millions of Haitians face food insecurity and given the choice between starvation and violence and illicit mi- gration, it is little wonder that people arrive at our borders. Though conditions in China are very different it is never easy for an individual to choose to migrate, and I believe that we as a Na- tion, particularly a Nation of immigrants, have an obligation to bring our immigration system into the 21st Century so that we can live up to the creed of our Nation. Dr. Oyen, what can you tell us about the demographics of the Chinese border-crossers and why they are leaving China and how they integrate into communities in the United States once they ar- rive? Ms. OYEN. Based on what has been reported so far, a lot of the reporting seems to be that they are from China’s expansive middle class. You will see that there are people who have spent a couple thousand equivalents of U.S. dollars to make the trip, and they have a harrowing journey through Ecuador and through the Darien Gap and up. There are people who spent tens of thousands of dollars which usually allowed them to fly the entire way to Tijuana and then cross the border. The reason why that, sort-of, expansive middle class seems to be the population that is moving, it is people who have something to sell, to have the money to do that, but it is also people who have been particularly severely hit by the zero-COVID policies and the economic fallout from the pandemic. So there is a lot of small business owners who have lost their businesses or have lost jobs or don’t see the kinds of jobs that they are looking for or don’t see opportunities available to them and so that becomes an argument for economic migration in this way. So the demographics do appear to be predominantly people trav- eling alone and predominantly male, based on the numbers who are coming into Ecuador which has visa-free entry from China. So it does appear to be that is the population that is most likely out of work, that very often can’t find and is not happy in China. In some cases there is, you know, demographic changes in China that make more men than women so and then, of course, there is historical reasons why Chinese men have usually undertaken risky immigration journeys. Ms. CLARKE. Very well. Well, Mr. Chairman, I really think that as part of a Committee on Homeland Security we have an obligation to really bring our im- migration laws into the 21st Century and do it in a bipartisan manner. I hope that you will be a proponent for that going forward and in the future. Having said that, I thank you for the opportunity and I yield back the balance of my time. Chairman BISHOP. The gentlewoman yields back. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Higgins for 5 minutes of ques- tioning. Mr. HIGGINS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.130 My colleagues across the aisle, I am just visiting this sub- committee today and I appreciate being here. I know I don’t have the right to vote because I am not on this subcommittee. I sit on another one, but I would have voted in support of my Republican colleagues today. Let the historical record reflect that fact. Let me also state that my Democrat colleagues across the aisle appear to be saying to Americans across the country that have en- dured border policies enacted on the day that President Biden was inaugurated and began his actions, Executive Actions to change the policy of this country to open our border. It wasn’t the cartels that changed on January 20, 2021. It was the President of the United States. It wasn’t the 1,954 miles of our border that changed in January 2021. It was a President of the United States changed our policies and the world was listening, was it not, Mr. Bensman, as you pointed out. So Americans that have endured 15 million illegals crossing into our country in 4 years, crime waves rolling across America from sea to shining sea, fentanyl poisoning killing 100,000 Americans per year, Americans across the country that have an objection to that, and we have got a problem with that. Apparently Democrats are saying we are all bunch of Nazis, white supremacists, antisemitic. This is disconnected from reality, man. America is suffering generational trauma because of the Biden administration policies that have blown our border wide open. Now immigrants of means, Chinese healthy and well-funded coming into our country being granted what? Asylum. Is a healthy, well-funded, warrior age, young men coming into our country, no- body over there has a problem with that? Mr. Bensman, you mentioned interviewing thousands you said. That is quite a lot. I would say that places you in the expert cat- egory, sir. How can we confirm who these Chinese nationals rolling across our Southern Border, thousands at a time now, how can we con- firm? How do we know who they are? They tell us. They give us a name. They give us some documentation, but they are healthy. They are well-funded. They could buy documentation anywhere, quality documentation. How do we know who they are? Are we taking any biometric data from them? Are we getting any documentation, DNA, fingerprints, retinal scans, photographs, et cetera? Mr. BENSMAN. We should be. There should be biometrics col- lected at different points along the trail in Panama, for example, Costa Rica, if they go through those. Mr. HIGGINS. At a processing center? Mr. BENSMAN. Yes, through the—— Mr. HIGGINS. You are talking about at a DHS-run processing center in another country. But does the United States, the DHS, have possession, from your experience of interviewing these thou- sands of illegal immigrants, does the United States have files on these people, who they are—fingerprints, retinal scans, et cetera? Mr. BENSMAN. I would say in general they do not. They will have, and especially they will have maybe a first fingerprint from131 somewhere along the trail. They may take them at the border once they get here, but they don’t really have anything to bounce them off against. Mr. HIGGINS. OK. So these—— Mr. BENSMAN. The real—— Mr. HIGGINS. These Chinese nationals coming into our country from Europe experience or then maybe anyone can answer this, are they are being reviewed for gang affiliations and gang tattoos, triad tattoos, et cetera? Mr. BENSMAN. No. Mr. HIGGINS. I see a no. Mr. SINGLETON. Currently, no. Mr. Singleton. Dr. Oyen, do you know if these Chinese nationals are at least, you know, being looked at for tattoos coming into our country? Ms. OYEN. I would not know that, no. Mr. HIGGINS. You don’t know. Mr. Hankinson, are they being checked? Mr. HANKINSON. I wouldn’t think they have the time to do a whole lot of checking given how quickly they are being released. Mr. HIGGINS. Take your shirt off, 10 seconds, tattoos, yes or no? We do it in jails across the country every day at the local, State, and Federal level. We look for tattoos, gang tattoos. We could do it at the border if we wanted to without hiring one more agent or spending one more penny. Take your shirt of. Do you have tattoos, yes or no? It is simple. We do it at jails across the country. Are we are doing that, Mr. Bensman? Mr. BENSMAN. I would say not. Mr. HIGGINS. That answer is no. The answer is no. Well, my goodness, I have expired my time, Mr. Chairman, but I have not expired my passion. Thank you, I yield. Chairman BISHOP. The gentleman yields back. I had some indication, an inkling that we might proceed to a sec- ond round of the questioning, but I don’t believe in the light of the turn of the hearing that we will do that. I had started off with great optimism about the nature of the hearing, but it is unfortu- nate. I will say it is amazing that the person injecting the acrimony is 1 of the 9 Democrats to vote against a resolution condemning the October 7 attack, also voted present on a resolution to bar Hamas members and those who participated in October 7 attack from en- tering our country. Astonishing. I will thank the witnesses for your valuable testimony and the Members for your questions. Members of the subcommittee may have additional questions for the witnesses, and we would ask the witnesses to respond in writing. Pursuant to committee rule VII(D), the hearing record will be open for 10 days. With that, the hearing is adjourned. [Whereupon, at 3:30 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]APPENDIX I QUESTIONS FROM HONORABLE AUGUST PFLUGER FOR SIMON R. HANKINSON Question 1a. The PRC has expanded its activities and influence in Latin America in recent years, financing and developing critical infrastructure and entrapping gov- ernments in debt through programs like the Belt and Road Initiative. China has also increased its military ties in Latin America, selling arms and equipment to Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador, and other countries in the region. What concerns should we have about China’s growing presence in the Western Hemisphere? Answer. Concerns about China’s recent activity in the Western Hemisphere are rooted in the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) concerted use of state power across domains. In Latin America, China uses political and economic power with its invest- ment in dual-use infrastructure to serve strategic objectives and facilitate potential future military integration. The Belt and Road Initiative is a key factor, as 21 states in the region hold membership, creating formal inroads to facilitate CCP influence in the region. In Peru, for example, CCP-owned China Southern Power Grid ac- quired approximately $3 billion in assets from their domestic power grid, leading to 70 percent Chinese control in this sector. Recent Chinese lithium mining investments in Argentina alone total more than $2 billion, and generally speaking China is outcompeting U.S. infrastructure invest- ments in Latin America. New CCP-backed infrastructure projects raise additional concern due to their dual-use and strategic implications. Seventeen Chinese infra- structure projects focused on constructing deep-water ports are now under way in the region, including multiple projects that surround the Panama Canal. Contracts for investment projects are carried out by state-owned companies, such as China Communications Construction (CCC) and China Ocean Shipping Company (COSCO), that are informally part of China’s expansive military-civil fusion pro- gram. Additionally, Chinese companies such as Huawei continue to create inroads through the construction of 4G and 5G telecommunications infrastructure through- out the region. The increased foothold could allow the CCP access to treasure troves of data by virtue of the PRC’s 2015 National Security Law, which requires all firms to actively contribute to national security and cooperate with Government requests for information. Question 1b. To what extent do you believe the Chinese Communist Party may be recruiting individuals in these countries to help carry out their influence in the United States? Answer. The CCP is working with Latin American countries to advance Chinese interests in the region at the expense of U.S. security and prosperity. Since the turn of the century, the PLA has conducted over 200 senior leader visits to Latin America and the Caribbean. Last year, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva con- cluded a visit to China by pledging to work with Beijing to ‘‘rebalance’’ global poli- tics and further their joint trading interests. A rebalancing of international systems and norms would benefit Chinese interests at the cost of American interests. Fur- thermore, the Wall Street Journal reported that Cuba is allowing China to build a surveillance facility for Chinese intelligence services to monitor maritime traffic and electronic communications from the United States. Beyond building ties with political leaders, China is also working to establish a cultural and educational relationship with the Latin American people. China has es- tablished at least 39 Confucious institutes in the region, which are Chinese propa- gandist institutions with known ties to China’s security and intelligence agencies. China also awards Hanban scholarships to Latin America’s best China scholars, along with free trips to China for academics and journalists, providing additional opportunities for recruitment and intelligence collection. (133)134 QUESTIONS FROM HONORABLE AUGUST PFLUGER FOR CRAIG SINGLETON Question 1. This Congress, the House Homeland Security Committee has led ef- forts to expose the malign and threatening activity occurring at clandestine Chinese Police Stations in the United States. In April 2023, the FBI arrested two individuals for operating a Chinese police station in Manhattan, New York, where they de- stroyed evidence, illegally stalked and assaulted people in the United States, con- ducted transnational repression, and ultimately obstructed justice. Recently, FBI Director Wray said, ‘‘The PRC has made it clear that it considers every sector that makes our society run as fair game in its bid to dominate on the world stage.’’ Now, this quote was in reference to civilian and critical infrastructure, but it sounds like they are already targeting the interworking of our civil society. A report in September 2022 revealed the presence of 110 Chinese police stations located around the world. In your opinion, what is the greatest threat posed by these Chinese police stations to U.S. citizens and our national security? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. Question 2a. As we’ve discussed in this committee before, the Chinese Communist Party has a pattern of engaging in transnational repression and intimidation tactics against Chinese nationals, affiliates, and especially dissidents living in the United States. While this is not a new strategy for the CCP, I imagine it has been exacer- bated by the increased presence of potentially malign actors with ties to the CCP crossing our border illegally. Do you believe the increase in transnational repression could be related to irreg- ular, illegal immigration of Chinese nationals, some of whom may have ties to the People’s Republic of China? Question 2b. What type of tactics does the CCP use, and do you expect them to continue? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication. QUESTION FROM HONORABLE AUGUST PFLUGER FOR TODD BENSMAN Question. The PRC has expanded its activities and influence in Latin America in recent years, financing and developing critical infrastructure and entrapping gov- ernments in debt through programs like the Belt and Road Initiative. China has also increased its military ties in Latin America, selling arms and equipment to Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador, and other countries in the region. The Associated Press recently reported that short video platforms and messaging apps are being used to provide on-the-ground footage and step-by-step guides from China to the United States, including tips on what to pack, how to survive in the jungle, what hotels and guides to use, how much to bribe police officers in certain countries along the way, and of course, what to do when encountering U.S. immigra- tion officers. Apps like TikTok and Douyin are the primary platforms for this com- munication. How might these practices be used to facilitate and assist PRC operatives once they are already in the United States? Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication.APPENDIX II STATEMENT OF MARTIN KIM, DIRECTOR, IMMIGRATION ADVOCACY, ASIAN AMERICANS ADVANCING JUSTICE—AAJC MAY 16, 2024 Chairman Bishop, Ranking Member Ivey, and Members of the subcommittee, I write today with great concern about how the recent increase in Chinese migration to the Southern Border has been framed by some members of this subcommittee. While there are legitimate and serious criticisms of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the Xi Jinping regime, those criticism do not justify the attacks we have seen on immigrants fleeing the repression of the CCP and present a risk to the broader Asian and Pacific Islander (API) community. Asian Americans Advancing Justice—AAJC (‘‘Advancing Justice—AAJC’’) is a na- tional non-profit organization founded in 1991 dedicated to advancing civil and human rights for Asian Americans. We strive to empower Asian American and Pa- cific Islander communities across the country by bringing local and national con- stituencies together and advocating for Federal policy that reflects the needs of Asian Americans and promotes a fair and equitable society for all. Advancing Jus- tice—AAJC is the leading national advocate for immigration and anti-racial profiling policy on behalf of the Asian American community, and in this capacity, we work to address the racial profiling and discriminatory targeting of Asian Ameri- cans and immigrants. As the subcommittee’s invited witnesses noted, the recent increase in Chinese mi- gration is due to a variety of factors, including increased oppression by the CCP and worsening economic conditions within China. These heightened pressures come at a moment when the wait times for Chinese immigrants looking to migrate through other channels have skyrocketed: according to the most recent visa bulletin, and as just one example, Chinese immigrants with approved family petitions who applied 3 to 17 years ago are only now eligible to receive family-based visas.1 As might be expected, the increased pressures leading people to leave China combined with the difficulty securing other pathways into the United States has led to a change in the historical migration patterns of this population. Given that the United States is a country that values democracy and individual liberty, it is no surprise that those fleeing repressive environments like the Xi Jinping regime seek to immigrate to the United States. In fact, it is precisely these kinds of immigrants that the United States should welcome. History is filled with examples of immigrants from totalitarian and repressive regimes seeking refuge here, whether they were Jewish immigrants who fled Nazi Germany or those seek- ing to leave the Soviet Union during the Cold War. We should not look at immi- grants, like those from China, coming to the United States from these conditions with automatic suspicion. However, instead of welcoming Chinese immigrants, Members of this sub- committee have called this new Chinese immigration ‘‘illegal’’ and claim that these immigrants represent a ‘‘security risk.’’ While it is true that the number of Chinese immigrants at the Southern Border has increased, it is important to note that—con- trary to the framing of this hearing—seeking asylum at the Southern Border is not illegal: it is a human right enshrined in international 2 and domestic law.3 Chinese 1 Visa Bulletin, U.S. Dep’t of State, Vol. X, No. 89 (May 2024), https://travel.state.gov/con- tent/travel/en/legal/visa-law0/visa-bulletin/2024/visa-bulletin-for-may-2024.html. 2 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, signed July 28, 1951, 189 U.N.T.S. 150 (en- tered into force April 22, 1954); Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees, signed Jan. 31, 1967, 606 U.N.T.S. 267 (entered into force October 4, 1967). 3 8 U.S.C. § 1158. (135)136 immigrants, like other immigrants, have the right to seek asylum here in the United States. Similarly, even though the CCP has engaged in activities seeking to undermine U.S. interests, there is no evidence that all or even a significant propor- tion of Chinese immigrants have strong ties to the CCP.4 When immigrants from China are singled out as ‘‘security risks’’ or as ‘‘spies’’ it can have significant, adverse, and even violent consequences for Chinese Americans and API communities more broadly.5 In the case of this hearing, the implication that Chinese immigrants fleeing China are a national security risk plays into histor- ical stereotypes of the ‘‘perpetual foreigner’’ and recent incidents of anti-Asian vio- lence. The rhetoric and framing deployed in this hearing fails to meaningfully dis- tinguish between the Chinese government and Chinese citizens. Instead, Members of this committee should seek to better understand the nuances that impact migra- tion patterns. As we have seen time and time again, overbroadly attributing anti-U.S. sentiment to Chinese people is not only a misrepresentation of a diverse group, but also leads to discriminatory blowback against the Asian American community in the United States. Racist stereotypes about Asian American ‘‘foreignness’’ and ‘‘disloyalty’’ have been used to justify incarceration, assault, and even the murder of our community members. During World War II, unfounded suspicion of Japanese Americans led to the forced incarceration of over 120,000 Japanese Americans by the U.S. Govern- ment. In 1982, anti-Japanese sentiment stemming from economic competition in the United States led to the brutal assault and murder of Chinese American Vincent Chin, who was mistaken as a Japanese American. After 9/11, misplaced blame for terrorist attacks fed directly into rampant Islamophobia and violent attacks against Muslim Americans, as well as Sikh and South Asian Americans who were inac- curately perceived to be Muslim. More recently during the peak of the COVID–19 pandemic, prominent politicians wrongfully attributed the disease to Chinese indi- viduals in our community, leading to a 339 percent increase in reported violent anti- Asian attacks across the United States.6 And even more recently, there has been a 180 percent increase in anti-Muslim hate incidents exacerbated by the conflict in Gaza, the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territories, and Israel.7 We agree with the subcommittee that the increase in Chinese immigration to the Southern Border is worthy of attention. We also agree that the threats posed by the Chinese government are real and should be explored. There are ways to do so with- out painting all API immigrants and Asian Americans as possible threats.8 For this reason, we ask that the Members of this subcommittee refrain from inflammatory rhetoric that will only serve to expose our communities to risk and weaken the United States as a whole. 4 Fu Ting, Ali Swenson, and Didi Tang, Trump suggests Chinese migrants are in the US to build an ‘army.’ The migrants tell another story, AP NEWS (May 14, 2024), https:// apnews.com/article/trump-china-immigrant-migrants-border-army-05478af9702aa8cc0264bb52- c8ba7bd9. 5 Viet Thanh Nguyen and Janelle Wong, Bipartisan political rhetoric about Asia leads to anti- Asian violence here, THE WASHINGTON POST (Mar. 19, 2021), https:// www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/atlanta-shooting-political-rhetoric-violence/2021/03/19/ f882f8e8-88b9-11eb-8a8b-5cf82c3dffe4lstory.html. 6 Kimmy Yam, Anti-Asian hate crimes increased 339 percent nationwide last year, report says, NBCNEWS.COM (Jan. 31, 2022, updated Feb. 14, 2022), https://www.nbcnews.com/news/ asian-america/anti-asian-hate-crimes-increased-339-percent-nationwide-last-year-repo-rcna14282 (last updated May 22, 2024). 7 Kanishka Singh, Anti-Muslim incidents jump in US amid Israel-Gaza war, REUTERS (Jan. 29, 2024), https://www.reuters.com/world/us/anti-muslim-incidents-jump-us-amid-israel-gaza- war-2024-01-29/; Nicquel Terry Ellis and Chandelis Duster, ‘Anxiety and fear are high:’ US Pal- estinians, Muslims fear a return to post-9/11 Islamophobia, CNN.COM (Oct. 17, 2023), https:// www.cnn.com/2023/10/17/us/us-palestinians-muslims-fear-islamophobia-surge-reaj/ index.html. 8 Asian Americans Advancing Justice/AAJC, Advancing Justice—AAJC Messaging Guidance, https://www.advancingjustice-aajc.org/publication/advancing-justice-aajc-messaging-guidance (updated Jan. 19, 2024).137 STATEMENT OF THE NISKANEN CENTER MAY 16, 2024 New data suggests political repression, slowing economy driving irregular Chinese migration to United States INTRODUCTION Despite intense interest from lawmakers and the media about Chinese migration through the Southern Border, reliable data sources about these migrants are lim- ited. One of the available sources is the annually updated Ecuadorian Statistical Reg- istry of International Entries and Exits. This database offers an invaluable glimpse into the characteristics of Chinese migrants entering Ecuador, the only mainland country in the Western Hemisphere that offers visa-free travel to Chinese nationals. Since most Chinese migrants enter the Americas via Ecuador, these records can reasonably be used to draw inferences about irregular Chinese migration. This as- sumption is supported by the net entry/exit data, which show that Chinese nationals entered Ecuador 48,381 times in 2023 but only left 24,240 times. The resulting entry/exit deficit was 24,141—by far the highest number of any nationality. Several other data points from the latest release, which summarizes 2023 inter- national entries, further strengthen our knowledge of irregular Chinese migration. For example, U.S. Customs and Border Protection data has shown a sharp increase in encounters with Chinese nationals in recent years. This increase is mirrored by the Ecuadorian travel data, which indicates a record high of 23,859 Chinese nation- als traveled to Ecuador at least once in 2023, an increase of almost 235 percent com- pared to the previous 5-year average. Some of the new data points, however, complicate our assumptions about who these migrants are. AREAS EXPERIENCING REPRESSION REMAIN OVERREPRESENTED Our analysis of last year’s data found that Hong Kong and Xinjiang, which have experienced acute levels of social and political repression by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in recent years, were overrepresented as cities of origin logged in Ecua- dorian entry data.138 This finding is replicated in this year’s data, with Hong Kong having the second- highest rate of travel to Ecuador per million and Xinjiang having the sixth. Hong Kong can be explained to some extent by the region’s relatively high eco- nomic development, airport presence, and overall population, making regular busi- ness travel and overrepresentation in the entry data plausible. However, two consecutive years of high proportional numbers from Xinjiang defy easy explanation. High levels of travel from the prefectures of Aksu and Altay heav- ily skew Xinjiang’s numbers. Aksu is 80 percent Uyghur, while Altay is majority Kazakh—which could indicate that the travelers from this region may not be Han Chinese or at least have first-hand familiarity with the CCP’s system of repression in this region. The most reasonable explanation for Xinjiang’s high numbers are that residents are especially motivated to escape the repressive CCP security apparatus in the re- gion. However, the numbers from this data set need to be stronger to indicate that per- secution is a necessary driver for irregular travel from China to Ecuador. Only two provinces saw no travel to Ecuador in 2022 and 2023: Qinghai, which is only 51 per- cent Han Chinese, and the Tibetan Autonomous Region, which is 86 percent ethnic Tibetan. Both provinces have experienced large-scale human rights violations but have yet to record the same levels of outbound travel as Xinjiang and Hong Kong. This sug- gests that other factors outside of possible social, religious, and political concerns are also significant in determining whether a region has a high amount of irregular emigration. DECLINING NORTHEASTERN REGIONS ALSO HIGH The provinces in China’s ‘‘rust belt’’ in the northeast have experienced a signifi- cant population decline in recent years, losing 30 percent of their population from 2010 to 2020. In this region, despite their plummeting populations, Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning are all in the top third of origin regions among Chinese travelers to Ecua- dor when adjusted for population, as indicated in this table by an asterisk.139 2023 Rate of Travel Region to Ecuador per Million Shanghai Municipality ................................................................................... 274 Hong Kong Special Administrative Region .................................................. 257 Beijing Municipality ....................................................................................... 161 Heilongjiang Province* .................................................................................. 123 Fujian Province ............................................................................................... 28 Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region .......................................................... 24 Macau Special Administrative Region .......................................................... 19 Jilin Province* ................................................................................................ 19 Hubei Province ............................................................................................... 11 Shaanxi Province ............................................................................................ 11 Liaoning Province* ......................................................................................... 9 Source: Author’s tabulation of data from Instituto Nacional de Estadı́stica y Censos, Registro Estadı́stico de Entradas y Salidas 2023. These regional reflections that China’s intensifying political persecution and a slowing economy likely contribute to irregular migration are supported by the broad- er Chinese demographic profile drawn from the Ecuadorian travel data. MOST TRAVELERS MALE, MIDDLE CLASS, UNDER 40 Chinese migrants encountered at the U.S.-Mexico border are often ominously re- ferred to as ‘‘military-aged males.’’ This data corroborates the fact that the migrants are largely young and male. In 2023, 71 percent of Chinese entrants to Ecuador were male, and 55 percent were between 15 and 39 years of age. Three factors almost certainly explain these demo- graphics, none indicating a national security risk. First, due to the one-child policy, China has a significant gender imbalance that has left many men struggling to find women they could marry. The pressure created by this imbalance has already created a market for trafficking within China, and it is reasonable to assume that young Chinese men could be motivated to undertake the journey if they believe it will make it easier to find a spouse. Second, social media has made the otherwise logistically daunting journey far more manageable and appealing, and young people are more likely to feel com- fortable using social media to navigate the journey. Finally, middle-class young men in China are the demographic most likely to have the means and capability to organize and complete the expensive and grueling route to the United States via Ecuador. Occupational data from entrants to Ecuador corroborate this explanation: Almost 80 percent were either high- or middle-skilled professionals, while less than 1 per- cent (and only 2 in total) listed ‘‘military’’ as their field of work.140 CONCLUSION There is no singular characteristic that explains why increasing numbers of asy- lum seekers from China are presenting themselves at the Southern Border. Stifling political repression, a slowing Chinese economy, the emergence of social media as a conduit for irregular travel, and a perceived limited window of opportunity are all mutually-compounding factors that together make the record 24,376 encounters with Chinese nationals recorded by U.S. CBP in fiscal year 2024 to date easier to comprehend. One popular explanation favored by some commentators is that these Chinese mi- grants are spies. As we have explained before, this interpretation is highly dubious. American policy makers interested in effectively rolling back the CCP should in- stead reject their assumption that any ethnic Chinese person owes them fealty and aggressively promote practical, bipartisan solutions that protect anti-communist dis- sidents and advance American Democracy as an alternative worldview. Olivia Enos at the Hudson Institute has convincingly made the case for stepping up enforcement of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act, and the Global Magnitsky Act to target CCP human rights viola- tions. At the level of immigration policy, the United States should better enable Chinese dissidents to access our refugee system. This can be done by passing the Uyghur Human Rights Protection Act and the Hong Kong Safe Harbor Act, which would allow dissidents from these areas to enjoy Priority Two (P–2) processing in the ref- ugee resettlement system, allowing them to enter the United States refugee pro- gram without a referral from the UNHCR, an embassy, or an NGO. Despite their authoritarian structure, the CCP does not control the narrative over irregular Chinese migration to the United States. Whether the United States de- cides to shape this narrative before it shapes us in the eyes of people seeking free- dom in China, East Asia, and the world is up to us.
